<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>It is time for some one to speak out. When
we compare the condition and prospects of
Science in all its branches, its organization, its
standards, its aims, its representatives with those
of Literature, how deplorable and how humiliating
is the contrast! In the one we see an
ordered realm, in the other mere chaos. The
one, serious, strenuous, progressive, is displaying
an energy as wonderful in what it has accomplished
as in what it promises to accomplish;
the other, without soul, without conscience, without
nerve, aimless, listless and decadent, appears
to be stagnating, almost entirely, into the monopoly
of those who are bent on futilizing and degrading
it.</p>

<p>Science stands where it does, not simply by
virtue of the genius, the industry, the example
of its most distinguished representatives, but because
by those representatives the whole sphere
of its activity is being directed and controlled.
The care of the Universities, the care of learned
societies, the care of devoted enthusiasts, its interests
and honour are watchfully and jealously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4" href="#Page_4">[4]</a></span>
guarded. The qualifications of its teachers are
guaranteed by tests prescribed by the highest
authorities on the subjects professed. To standards
fixed and maintained by those authorities
is referred every serious contribution to its
literature. Even a popular lecturer, or a popular
writer, who undertook to be its exponent would
be exploded at once if he displayed ignorance
and incompetence. Such, indeed, is the solidarity
of its energies that it is rather in the degrees
and phases of their manifestation than in their
essence and characteristics that they vary.
There is not a scientific institution in England
the regulations and aims of which do not bear
the impress of such masters as Huxley and
Tyndall and their disciples; not a work issuing
from the scientific Press which is not a proof
of the influence which such men have exercised
and are exercising, and of the high standard
exacted and attained wherever Science is taught
and interpreted.</p>

<p>It is far otherwise with Literature. Those
who represent it, in a sense analogous to that
in which the men who have been referred to
represent Science, have neither voice nor influence
in its organization, as a subject of instruction,
at the centres of education. They
neither give it the ply, nor in any way affect
its standards and its character in practice and
production. As examples few follow them, as
counsellors no one heeds them. They constitute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5" href="#Page_5">[5]</a></span>
what is little more than an esoteric body,
moving in a sphere of its own.</p>

<p>And yet there is no reason at all why there
should not be the same solidarity in the activity
of Literature as there is in the activity of Science,
and why the standard of aim and attainment
in the one should not be as high as in the other.
But this can never be accomplished until certain
radical reforms are instituted, and the first step
towards reform is to demonstrate the necessity
for it. I have done so here. I have drawn attention
to the state of things in our Universities,—in
other words, to what I must take leave to
call the scandalous and incredible indifference of
the Councils of those Universities to the appeals
which have, during the last fifteen years, been
made to them to place the study of Literature, in
the proper sense of the term, upon the footing
on which they have placed other studies. I have
pointed out what have been, and what must
continue to be, the effects of that indifference.
I have given specimens of the books to which
the Universities are not ashamed to affix their
<i>imprimatur</i>, and I have shown that, so far from
them considering even their reputation involved
in such a matter, they do not scruple to circulate
works teeming with blunders and absurdities of
the grossest kind, blunders and absurdities to
which their attention has been publicly called
over and over again. I have given specimens
of the kind of works which the occupants of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6" href="#Page_6">[6]</a></span>
distinguished Chairs of Literature can, with perfect
impunity, address to students; and I would
ask any scientific man what would be thought
of a Professor, say, of the Royal Naval College,
or of the City and Guilds of London Institute,
who should put his name to analogous publications—to
publications, that is to say, as unsound
in their theories, as inaccurate in their facts, as
slovenly and perfunctory in general execution,
as those to which I have here directed attention?
If such things are done in the green tree, what
is likely to be done in the dry? or, as Chaucer
puts it, "if gold ruste, what schal yren doo?"
That is one of the questions on which these
essays may, perhaps, throw some light.</p>

<p>To be misrepresented and misunderstood is
the certain fate of a book like this, and I am
well aware of the responsibilities incurred in
undertaking it. It is very distasteful to me to
give pain or cause annoyance to any one, and,
whether I am believed or not, I can say, with
strict truth, that I have not the smallest personal
bias against any of those whom I have censured
most severely. I believe, for the reasons
already explained, that Belles Lettres are sinking
deeper and deeper into degradation, that
they are gradually passing out of the hands of
their true representatives, and becoming almost
the monopoly of their false representatives, and
that the consequence of this cannot but be most
disastrous to us as a nation, to our reputation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7" href="#Page_7">[7]</a></span>
in the World of Letters, to taste, to tone, to
morals. It is surely a shame and a crime in
any one, and more especially in men occupying
positions of influence and authority, to assist in
the work of corruption, either by deliberately
writing bad books or by conniving, as critics, at
the production of bad books; and I am very
sure it has become a duty, and an imperative
duty, to expose and denounce them.</p>

<p>These essays are partly a protest and partly
an experiment. As a protest they explain, and, I
hope, justify themselves; as an experiment they
are an attempt to illustrate what we should be
fortunate if we could see more frequently illustrated
by abler hands. They are a series of
studies in serious, patient, and absolutely impartial
criticism, having for its object a comprehensive
survey of the vices and defects, as well as
of the merits, characteristic of current Belles
Lettres. I do not suppose that anything I have
said will have the smallest effect on the present
generation, but on the rising generation I believe
that much which has been said will not be
thrown away. In any case, what I was constrained
to write I have written. And it is my
last word in a long controversy.</p>

<p>It remains to add that most of these essays
appeared originally in the <i>Saturday Review</i>, and
I desire to express my thanks to the late and present
Editors, not merely for permission to reproduce
the essays, but for much kindness besides.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8" href="#Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Three appeared in the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, and
one, the first essay on "English Literature
at the Universities," in the <i>Nineteenth Century</i>;
and my thanks are due to the Editor of the <i>Pall
Mall Gazette</i> and to Mr. Knowles. But all of
them have been carefully revised and greatly
enlarged, in some cases to more than double
their original form. The introductory essay is,
with the exception of the opening pages, in
which I have drawn on an old article of mine in
the <i>Quarterly Review</i>, quite new; and, indeed,
that may be said of a great part of the volume.</p>

NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION</p>

<p>I regret to find that I have <a name="Correct2" id="Correct2">done M. Jusserand
grave injustice</a> in censuring him for being
ignorant of the existence of the <i>Speculum
Meditantis</i>, the MS. of which was identified after
the publication of his work.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_PRESENT_FUNCTIONS_OF_CRITICISM" id="THE_PRESENT_FUNCTIONS_OF_CRITICISM">
</a>THE PRESENT FUNCTIONS OF CRITICISM</h2>


<p>It may sound paradoxical to say that the more
widely education spreads, the more generally
intelligent a nation becomes, the greater is
the danger to which Art and Letters are exposed.
And yet how obviously is this the case,
and how easily is this explained. The quality
of skilled work depends mainly on the standard
required of the workman. If his judges and
patrons belong to the discerning few who,
knowing what is excellent, are intolerant of
everything which falls short of excellence, the
standard required will necessarily be a high one,
and the standard required will be the standard
attained. In past times, for example, the only
men of letters who were respected formed a
portion of that highly cultivated class who will
always be in the minority; and to that class,
and to that class only, they appealed. A community
within a community, they regarded the
general public with as much indifference as the
general public regarded them, and wrote only
for themselves, and for those who stood on the
same intellectual level as themselves. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14" href="#Page_14">[14]</a></span>
so in the Athens of Pericles; it was so in the
Rome of Augustus; it was so in the Florence
of the Medici; and a striking example of the
same thing is to be found in our own Elizabethan
Dramatists. Though their bread depended
on the brutal and illiterate savages for
whose amusement they catered, they still talked
the language of scholars and poets, and forced
their rude hearers to sit out works which could
have been intelligible only to scholars and poets.
Each felt with pride that he belonged to a great
guild, which neither had, nor affected to have,
anything in common with the multitude. Each
strove only for the applause of those whose
praise is not lightly given. Each spurred the
other on. When Marlowe worked, he worked
with the fear of Greene before his eyes, as
Shakespeare was put on his mettle by Jonson,
and Jonson by Shakespeare. We owe <i>Hamlet</i>
and <i>Sejanus</i>, <i>Much Ado about Nothing</i> and the
<i>Alchemist</i>, not to men who bid only for the
suffrage of the mob, but to men who stood in
awe of the verdict which would be passed on
them by the company assembled at the Mermaid
and the Devil.</p>

<p>As long as men of letters continue to form
an intellectual aristocracy, and, stimulated by
mutual rivalry, strain every nerve to excel, and
as long also as they have no temptation to
pander to the crowd, so long will Literature
maintain its dignity, and so long will the standard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15" href="#Page_15">[15]</a></span>
attained in Literature be a high one. In
the days of Dryden and Pope, in the days even
of Johnson and Gibbon, the greater part of
the general public either read nothing, or read
nothing but politics and sermons. The few
who were interested in Poetry, in Criticism,
in History, were, as a rule, those who had
received a learned education, men of highly
cultivated tastes and of considerable attainments.
A writer, therefore, who aspired to
contribute to polite literature, had to choose
between finding no readers at all, and finding
such readers as he was bound to respect—between
instant oblivion, and satisfying a class
which, composed of scholars, would have turned
with contempt from writings unworthy of
scholars. A classical style, a refined tone, and
an adequate acquaintance with the chief authors
of Ancient Rome and of Modern France,
were requisites, without which even a periodical
essayist would have had small hope of obtaining
a hearing. Whoever will turn, we do not say
to the papers of Addison and his circle in the
early part of the last century, or to those of
Chesterfield and his circle later on, but to the
average critical work of Cave's and Dodsley's
hack writers, cannot fail to be struck with its
remarkable merit in point of literary execution.</p>

<p>But as education spreads, a very different
class of readers call into being a very different
class of writers. Men and women begin to seek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16" href="#Page_16">[16]</a></span>
in books the amusement or excitement which
they sought formerly in social dissipation. To
the old public of scholars succeeds a public, in
which every section of society has its representatives,
and to provide this vast body with
the sort of reading which is acceptable to it,
becomes a thriving and lucrative calling. An
immense literature springs up, which has no
other object than to catch the popular ear, and
no higher aim than to please for the moment.
That perpetual craving for novelty, which has
in all ages been characteristic of the multitude,
necessitates in authors of this class a corresponding
rapidity of production. The writer of
a single good book is soon forgotten by his
contemporaries; but the writer of a series of
bad books is sure of reputation and emolument.
Indeed, a good book and a bad book stand,
so far as the general public is concerned, on
precisely the same level, as they meet with
precisely the same fate. Each presents the
attraction of a new title-page. Each is glanced
through, and tossed aside. Each is estimated
not by its intrinsic worth, but according to the
skill with which it has been puffed. Till within
comparatively recent times this literature was,
for the most part, represented by novels and
poems, and by those light and desultory essays,
sketches and <i>ana</i>, which are the staple commodity
of our magazines. And so long as it
confined itself within these bounds it did no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17" href="#Page_17">[17]</a></span>
mischief, and even some good. Flimsy and
superficial though it was, it had at least the
merit of interesting thousands in Art and Letters,
who would otherwise have been indifferent
to them. It afforded nutriment to minds which
would have rejected more solid fare. To men
of business and pleasure who, though no longer
students, still retained the tincture of early
culture, it offered the most agreeable of all
methods of killing time, while scholars found
in it welcome relaxation from severer studies.
It thus supplied a want. Presenting attractions
not to one class only, but to all classes, it grew
on the world. Its patrons, who half a century
ago numbered thousands, now number millions.</p>

<p>And as it has grown in favour, it has grown
in ambition. It is no longer satisfied with the
humble province which it once held, but is extending
its dominion in all directions. It has
its representatives in every department of Art
and Letters. It has its poets, its critics, its
philosophers, its historians. It crowds not our
club-tables and news-stalls only, but our libraries.
Thus what was originally a mere excrescence
on literature, in the proper sense of the
term, has now assumed proportions so gigantic,
that it has not merely overshadowed that literature,
but threatens to supersede it.</p>

<p>No thoughtful man can contemplate the present
condition of current literature without
disgust and alarm. We have still, indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18" href="#Page_18">[18]</a></span>
lingering among us a few masters whose works
would have been an honour to any age; and
here and there among writers may be discerned
men who are honourably distinguished by a
conscientious desire to excel, men who respect
themselves, and respect their calling. But to
say that these are in the minority, would be to
give a very imperfect idea of the proportion
which their numbers bear to those who figure
most prominently before the public. They are,
in truth, as tens are to myriads. Their comparative
insignificance is such, that they are
powerless even to leaven the mass. The position
which they would have occupied half a
century ago, and which they may possibly
occupy half a century hence, is now usurped by
a herd of scribblers who have succeeded, partly
by sheer force of numbers, and partly by judicious
co-operation, in all but dominating literature.
Scarcely a day passes in which some book
is not hurried into the world, which owes its
existence not to any desire on the part of its
author to add to the stores of useful literature,
or even to a hope of obtaining money, but
simply to that paltry vanity which thrives on
the sort of homage of which society of a certain
kind is not grudging, and which knows no distinction
between notoriety and fame. A few
years ago a man who contributed articles to a
current periodical, or who delivered a course of
lectures, had, as a rule, the good sense to know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19" href="#Page_19">[19]</a></span>
that when they had fulfilled the purpose for
which they were originally intended, the world
had no more concern with them, and he would
as soon have thought of inflicting them in the
shape of a volume on the public, as he would
have thought of issuing an edition of his private
letters to his friends. Now all is changed. The
first article in the creed of a person who has
figured in either of these capacities, appears to
be, that he is bound to force himself into notice
in the character of an author. And this, happily
for himself, but unhappily for the interests
of literature, he is able to do with perfect
facility and with perfect impunity. Books are
speedily manufactured and as speedily reduced
to pulp. A worthless book may be as easily
invested with those superficial attractions which
catch the eye of the crowd as a meritorious one.
As the general public are the willing dupes of
puffers, it is no more difficult to palm off on
them the spurious wares of literary charlatans,
than it is to beguile them into purchasing the
wares of any other kind of charlatan. No one
is interested in telling them the truth. Many,
on the contrary, are interested in deceiving
them. As a rule, the men who write bad books
are the men who criticise bad books; and as
they know that what they mete out in their
capacity of judges to-day is what will in turn
be meted out to them in their capacity of
authors to-morrow, it is not surprising that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20" href="#Page_20">[20]</a></span>
the relations between them should be similar
to those which Tacitus tells us existed between
Vinius and Tigellinus—"nulla innocentiæ cura,
sed vices impunitatis."</p>

<p>Meanwhile all those vile arts which were
formerly confined to the circulators of bad
novels and bad poems are practised without
shame. It is shocking, it is disgusting to contemplate
the devices to which many men of
letters will stoop for the sake of exalting themselves
into a factitious reputation. They will
form cliques for the purpose of mutual puffery.
They will descend to the basest methods of self-advertisement.
And the evil is fast-spreading.
Indeed, things have come to such a pass, that
persons of real merit, if they have the misfortune
to depend on their pens for a livelihood,
must either submit to be elbowed and jostled
out of the field, or take part in the same ignoble
scramble for notoriety, and the same detestable
system of mutual puffery. Thus everything
which formerly tended to raise the standard of
literary ambition and literary attainment has
given place to everything which tends to degrade
it. The multitude now stand where the scholar
once stood. From the multitude emanate, to
the multitude are addressed two-thirds of the
publications which pour forth, every year, from
our presses.</p>

<p>Matthew Arnold very truly observed, that one of
the most unfortunate tendencies of our time was
the tendency to over-estimate the performances
of "the average man." The over-estimation of
these performances is no longer a tendency, but
an established custom. Literature, in all its
branches, is rapidly becoming his monopoly.
As judged and judge, as author and critic,
there is every indication that he will proceed
from triumph to triumph, and establish his
cult wherever books are read. Now the only
sphere in which "the average man" is entitled
to homage is a moral one, and he is most venerable
when he is passive and unambitious. But
if ambition and the love of fame are awakened
in him, he is capable of becoming exceedingly
corrupt and of forfeiting every title to veneration.
He is capable of resorting to all the
devices to which men are forced to resort in
manufacturing factitious reputations, to imposture,
to fraud, to circulating false currencies of
his own, and to assisting others in the circulation
of theirs. Even when he is free from these
vices, so far as their deliberate practice is concerned,
he is scarcely less mischievous, if he be
uncontrolled. To say that his standard is never
likely to be a high one, either with reference to
his own achievements or with reference to what
he exacts from others, and to say that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22" href="#Page_22">[22]</a></span>
systematic substitution of inferior standards for
high ones must affect literature and all that
is involved in its influence, most disastrously,
is to say what will be generally acknowledged.
And he has everything, unhappily, in his favour—numbers,
influence, the spirit of the age.
For one who sees through him and takes
his measure, there are thousands who do not:
for one who could discern the justice of an
exposure of his shortcomings, there are thousands
who would attribute that exposure to
personal enmity and to dishonest motives. His
power, indeed, is becoming almost irresistible.
The one thing which he and his fellows
thoroughly understand is the formidable advantage
of co-operation. The consequence is that
there are probably not half a dozen reviews
and newspapers now left which they are not
able practically to coerce. An editor is obliged
to assume honesty in those who contribute to
his columns, and also to avail himself of the
services of men who can write good articles, if
they write bad books. In the first case, it is
not open to him to question the justice of the
verdict pronounced; in the second case, the
courtesy of the gentleman very naturally and
properly predominates, under such circumstances,
over public considerations—and how
can truth be told? Nor is this all. Assuming
that an editor is free from such ties, he has
to consult the interests of his paper, to study<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23" href="#Page_23">[23]</a></span>
popularity, and not to estrange those who are,
from a commercial point of view, the mainstays
of all our literary journals, those who
advertise in them,—the publishers. "If," said
an editor to me once, "I were to tell the
truth, as forcibly as I could wish to do, about
the books sent to me for review, in six months
my proprietors would be in the bankruptcy
court." It is in the power of the publishers to
ruin any literary journal. There is probably
not a single Review in London which would
survive the withdrawal of the publishers' advertisements.</p>

<p>A more honourable class of men than those who
form the majority of the London publishers does
not exist, nor have the interests of Literature,
as distinguished from commercial interests, ever
found heartier and more ungrudging support,
than they have long found in three or four of
the leading firms, and as they are now finding in
two or three of the firms which have been more
recently established. But, unhappily, this is not
everywhere the case. While the firms, to which I
have referred, have never, in any way, attempted
to interfere with the independence of reviewers,
others have made no secret of their intention to
make their patronage in advertisement dependent
on favourable notices of their publications.
The strain of temptation and peril to which
editors are thus exposed may be estimated by
the fact that, a flattering review may, if supplemented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24" href="#Page_24">[24]</a></span>
by similar ones, put some three hundred
a year into the pockets of their proprietors,
while severity and justice would involve a corresponding
loss. It need hardly be said that no
editor of a respectable review would allow any
definite understanding of this kind to exist, or
that any publisher would ever dare to suggest
it, but there can be no doubt that such considerations
have to be taken into account almost
universally, and place serious restraint on freedom
of judgment.</p>

<p>There is, it is true, another aspect of this
question. Publishers must protect themselves.
Though reviews offend much more frequently
on the side of dishonest and interested puffery,
they are very often made the vehicles of equally
unscrupulous rancour and spite. If they do
their readers injustice, by attempting to foist
bad books on them, they do every one concerned
injustice, by damning good ones. No one could
blame a publisher for declining to support a
paper which was continually making his books
the subjects of unmerited attacks. But a publisher
who attempts to prevent the truth from
being told, and so secures, or seeks to secure,
currency for his spurious wares, is guilty of an
act which borders closely on fraud.</p>

<p>Another circumstance very favourable to the
encouragement of inferiority, and not of inferiority
only, but of charlatanism and imposture,
is the increasing tendency to regard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25" href="#Page_25">[25]</a></span>
nothing of importance compared with the spirit
of tolerance and charity. An all-embracing
philanthropy exempts nothing from its protection.
Every one must be good-natured. Severity,
we are told, is quite out of fashion. Such censors
as the old reviewers are now mere anachronisms.
It is vain to plead that tolerance and charity
must discriminate; that, like other virtues, they
may be abused, and that in their abuse they
may become immoral; that there are higher
considerations than the feelings of individuals;
and that, if to give pain or annoyance admits
of no justification but necessity, necessity may
exact their infliction as an exigent duty.</p>

<p>But this spirit of tolerance and charity has
also become attenuated into the spirit of mere
<i>laissez-faire</i>. We have no lack of real scholars
and of real critics, who see through the whole
thing, and probably deplore it; but they make
no sign, look on with a sort of amused perplexity,
and do their own work, thankful, no
doubt, sometimes, when it is oppressive, that
they need not be over-scrupulous about its
quality. If, occasionally, they get a little impatient
and indulge their genius, protest goes
no further than sarcasm and irony, so fine that
it is intelligible only among themselves; while
the objects of their satire, as well as the general
public, missing the one and misinterpreting the
other, take it all for applause. Resistance, it is
said, is useless. Literature is a trade. What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26" href="#Page_26">[26]</a></span>
has come was inevitable: <i>vive la bagatelle</i>, and
drift with the stream.</p>

<p>And now let us consider what are the results
of all this. The first and most important is the
degradation of criticism. Criticism is to Literature
what legislation and government are to
States. If they are in able and honest hands
all goes well; if they are in weak and dishonest
hands all is anarchy and mischief. And as
government in a Republic, the true analogy to
the sphere of which we are speaking, is represented
not by those who form the minority
in its councils, but by those who form the majority,
so in criticism, it is not on the few but
on the many among those who represent it, that
its authority and influence depend. And what
are its characteristics in the hands of its prevailing
majority—in the hands of those who are
its legislators in a realm co-extensive with the
reading world? It is not criticism at all. To
criticism, in the true sense of the term, it has no
claim even to approximation. It seems to have
resolved itself into something which wants a
name,—something which is partly dithyramb
and partly rhetoric. Without standards, without
touchstones, without principles, without knowledge,
it appears to be regarded as the one calling
for which no equipment and no training are
needed. What a master of the art has called the
final fruit of careful discipline and of much experience
is assumed to come spontaneously. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27" href="#Page_27">[27]</a></span>
man of literary tastes is born cultured. A critic,
like a poet, is the pure product of nature. Such
canons as these "critics" have are the mysterious
and somewhat perplexing evolutions of their
own inner consciousness, or derived, not from
the study of classical writers in English or in
any other language, of all of whom they are
probably profoundly ignorant, but from a
current acquaintance with the writings of contemporaries,
who are, in intelligence and performance,
a little in advance of themselves.
But what they lack in attainments they make
up in impudence. The effrontery of some of
these "critics," whose verdicts, ludicrous to
relate, are daily recorded as "opinions of the
Press," literally exceeds belief. They will sit in
judgment on books written in languages of
whose very alphabets they are ignorant. They
will pose as authorities and pronounce <i>ex
cathedrâ</i> on subjects literary, historical, and
scientific of which they know nothing more
than what they have contrived to pick up from
the works which they are "reviewing." Their
estimates of the books, on the merits and
demerits of which they undertake to enlighten
the public, correspond with their qualifications
for forming them. Books displaying in their
writers the grossest ignorance of the very
rudiments of the subjects treated, and literally
swarming with blunders and absurdities, all of
which pass undetected and unnoticed, are made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28" href="#Page_28">[28]</a></span>
the subjects of elaborate panegyrics, which
would need some qualification if applied to the
very classics in the subjects under discussion.
Books, on the other hand, of unusual and
distinguished merit are despatched summarily
in a few lines of equally undeserved depreciation;
books written in the worst taste and in the vilest
style are pronounced to be models of both.
Sobriety, measure, and discrimination have no
place either in the creed or in the practice of
these writers. They think in superlatives; they
express themselves in superlatives. It never
seems to occur to them that if criticism has to
reckon with Mr. Le Gallienne it has also to reckon
with Shakespeare; that if it has to take the
measure of Mr. Hall Caine, it has likewise to
take the measure of Cervantes and Fielding, and
that of some dozen prose writers and poets, it
cannot be pronounced, at the same time of each,
that he is "the greatest living master of English
prose," or "without parallel for his superlative
command of all the resources of rhythmical
expression." There is one accomplishment in
which these critics are particularly adroit, and
that is in keeping out of controversy, and so
avoiding all chance of being called to account.
For this reason they deal more in eulogy than
in censure, for the public is less likely to
complain of a bad book being foisted on them
for a good one, than its irate author to sit silent
under reproof.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29" href="#Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>If we go a little higher, things are almost as
bad, if not quite so ridiculous. In everything but
in criticism it is necessary to specialize. A man
who posed as an authority on all the literatures
of the world, and on the history of every nation
in the world, would be very justly set down as
an impostor. And yet pretentions which men
would be the first to ridicule, as private individuals,
they do not scruple to claim, as critics.
An historical student enriches History with a
volume throwing new and important light on
some obscure episode or period; a classical
student deserves the gratitude of scholars for an
invaluable monograph; English Literature or one
of the Continental Literatures is illustrated by a
series of dissertations as instructive as they are
original; or a truly memorable contribution has
been made to political philosophy, to æsthetics,
or to ethics. What is their fate? It is by no
means improbable that they will be 'reviewed,' in
the course of a few days, by the same man for
three or four, or it may be for five or six, daily and
weekly journals, and their fortune in the market
made or marred by a censor who has probably
done no more than glance at their half-cut pages,
and who, if he had studied them from end to
end, would have been no more competent to take
their measure than he would have been to write
them. This leads, it is needless to say, to every
kind of abuse: to works which deserve to be
authorities on the subjects of which they treat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30" href="#Page_30">[30]</a></span>
dropping at once into oblivion, to works which
every scholar knows to be below contempt
usurping their places; to the deprivation of all
stimulus to honourable exertion on the part
of authors of ability and industry; to the encouragement
of charlatans and fribbles; to
gross impositions on the public. A very amusing
and edifying record might be compiled
partly out of a selection of the various verdicts
passed contemporaneously by reviews on particular
works, and partly out of comparisons of
the subsequent fortunes of works with their
fortunes while submitted to this censorship.</p>

<p>But it is not these causes only which contribute
to the degradation of criticism. A very
important factor is the prevalence, or rather the
predominance, of mere prejudice, the prejudice
of cliques in favour of cliques, the prejudice of
cliques against cliques, the prejudice of the
veteran against or in favour of the novice, the
subsequent compensation, in corresponding prejudice
on the part of the novice, when his
novitiate is over. The two things which never
seem to be considered are the interests of Literature
and the interests of the public. The appearance
of a work by the member of a particular
coterie is the signal, on the one hand, for a series
of preposterously intemperate eulogies, and for
a series, on the other hand, of equally intemperate
depreciations, in such organs as are accessible to
both parties. If a work, with any pretension to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31" href="#Page_31">[31]</a></span>
originality, by a previously unknown author
makes its appearance, it is pretty sure to fare
in one of three ways: it will scarcely be noticed
at all; it will be made the theme of a philippic
against innovating eccentricities and newfangled
notions; or it will fall into the hands
of a critic who is on the look-out for a "discovery."
Its fortune, so far as notoriety is concerned,
will, in that case, be made. The critic,
thus on his mettle and with his character for discernment
at stake, will not only become proportionately
vociferous but will rally his equally
vociferous partisans. Hyperbole will be heaped
on hyperbole, rodomontade on rodomontade,
till real merit will be made ridiculous, and
the unhappy author awake at last, to assume
his true proportions, in a Fool's Paradise.</p>

<p>And to this pass has criticism come, and
Literature generally, in almost all its branches,
is necessarily following suit. It would be no exaggeration
to say, that the sole encouragement
now left to authors to produce good books is
the satisfaction of their own conscience, and the
approbation of a few discerning judges; and
this attained, they must starve if their bread
depends upon their pen. It is not that a good
book will not be praised, but that bad books
are praised still more; it is not that it will fail
to find fair and competent reviewers, but that
for one fair and competent reviewer it will find
fifty who are unfair and incompetent. It is on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32" href="#Page_32">[32]</a></span>
its acceptance, not with the few who can estimate
its merits, but with the many who take
that estimate on trust from judges, whose competence
or incompetence they are equally unable
to gauge, that the possibility of a book yielding
any return to its author depends. The public
neither can nor will distinguish. A book which
has two or three favourable press notices which
are merited cannot stand against a book having
twenty or thirty which are unmerited. Nor is
this all. Measured and discriminating eulogy,
which means precisely what it expresses, and
which is always the note of sound and just
criticism, is to the uninitiated poor recommendation
compared with that which has no limitation
but extremes. How can the still small
voice of truth expect to get a hearing amid a
bellowing Babel of its undistinguishable mimic?
What inducement has an author to aim at excellence,
to spend three or four years on a monograph
or a history that it may be sold for waste
paper, when some miserable compilation, vamped
up in as many weeks, will, with a little management,
give him notoriety and fill his purse?
There is not a scholar, not a discerning reader in
England who will not bear me witness when I say
that, as a rule, the best books produced in Belles
Lettres are those of which the general public
knows nothing, and that he has been guided
to them sometimes by pure accident, and sometimes,
it may be, by a depreciatory notice or curt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33" href="#Page_33">[33]</a></span>
paragraph in "our library table" limbo. And
what does this mean? It means that a writer
has discovered that it is impossible for him to
have a conscience, or aim at an honourable reputation,
unless he can afford to lose money. It
means more; it means that publishers are
obliged to discourage the production of solid and
scholarly works. It is notorious that the Delegates
of the Clarendon Press at Oxford, and one
or two firms in London, having regard to the
honourable traditions of their predecessors, have
wished to maintain those traditions by encouraging
the production of such works, and
have, at a great pecuniary loss, persevered in
this ambition. But no publisher can continue
to multiply books which do not pay their
expenses, and whose sale begins and ends in
the remainder market.</p>

<p>This state of things is the more deplorable
when we consider its effect, not merely in degrading
and corrupting Literature on its productive
side, but in detracting so seriously from
its efficacy on its influential side. During the
last few years the rapid spread of higher
education, the popularization of liberal culture
through such agencies as the University Extension
Lectures, the National Home Reading
Union and similar institutions have called into
being an immense and constantly multiplying
class of serious readers and students. These
already number tens of thousands, they will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34" href="#Page_34">[34]</a></span>
before long number hundreds of thousands.
Now it is of the utmost importance that these
readers, who are quite prepared to appreciate
what is excellent, should be guided to what is
excellent, and discouraged in every way from
conversing with what is bad and inferior in
Literature. But how is this to be done when
those who are striving, in every way, to raise
the standard of popular taste and of popular
culture, as teachers, find all their efforts counteracted
by the intense activity of those who are
doing their utmost to degrade both, as writers.
It is only those engaged in education, and more
particularly in popular education, who can understand
the extent of the mischief which bookmakers
and the puffers of bookmakers are
doing, who can understand the tone, the taste,
the temper induced by the habitual and exclusive
perusal of the writings characteristic of
these pests,—the inaccuracies and errors, the
misrepresentations and absurdities, to which
these writings give currency.</p>

<p>In the days of our forefathers, a reader of
literary tastes, if he wished to acquaint himself
with an English classic, went to the fountain
head and read Spenser or Milton, Pope or
Addison for himself. If he desired to know
what criticism had said about them, he had
criticism of authority at hand, and he consulted
it. In our day it is about an even
chance whether the ordinary reader would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35" href="#Page_35">[35]</a></span>
trouble himself to turn to the originals or not:
he would probably content himself with the
notices of them in some current manual of
English Literature, or with some essay or monograph.
Now, in the myriads of such publications,
in vogue or out of vogue, knocked under
by their successors or scuffling with their
contemporaries, he might have the luck to
light on a good guide; he might have the luck
to light on Dean Church, or Mark Pattison, or
Mr. Leslie Stephen, or Professor Courthope, or
Mr. Frederic Harrison; but he is much more
likely to make his way to a luminary in the
last well-puffed "series." The first article in
the creed of the modern book-maker seems
to be that the appearance or existence of a
good book is a sufficient justification for the
production of a bad one to take its place. An
excellent monograph is published, and is popular.
This is the signal for the manufacture of
half a dozen inferior ones, which are mutually
destructive, and serve no end except to substitute
bad books for a good one, and to make
the good one forgotten. Again, a work which
has long been classical in criticism is assumed
not to be "up to date," and is either edited on
this hypothesis, or we have another substituted
for it. This in turn yields its vogue—for
fashions change quickly in modern taste—to a
similar experiment, till a third is announced. Of
the relation of criticism to principles, or indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36" href="#Page_36">[36]</a></span>
to anything else but to their own whims or
impressions, these iconoclasts appear to be profoundly
unaware.</p>

<p>It requires, needless to say, the utmost
wariness and care on the part of those who
regulate, and on the part of those who are engaged
in, education, to keep this inferior literature
in its place. If it were allowed to make its
way authoritatively into our schools and Universities,
or indeed into any of our educational
institutions, the consequences would be most
disastrous. It is not so much that it would
disseminate error as that it would become influential
in more serious ways, æsthetically in
its influence on taste, morally in its influence on
tone and character, intellectually in lowering the
whole standard of aim and attainment in studies.</p>

<p>That the evils which have been described
admit of no remedy at present, or perhaps in
the present generation, may be fully conceded.
But they may be palliated if they cannot be
cured, and they must be palliated by the agents
to whom we may ultimately look for their cure,
education and fearless criticism. As their origin
may be mainly ascribed to the failure of the
Universities to adapt themselves to new conditions,
so on the willingness of the Universities
to repair their error must depend all possibility
of rectifying the results of it. From its organization
at the Universities everything comprehended
in the system of liberal study takes its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37" href="#Page_37">[37]</a></span>
ply; its standards are there determined, its
methods formulated, its aims defined. As a
subject of teaching, and as the result of teaching,
in its relation to theory and in its relation
to practice, it there receives an impression which
is permanent. It has been so with classical
scholarship, and with Philology; it has been
so with Philosophy and Theology, with Jurisprudence
and History. What has been imparted
in the lecture-rooms of Oxford and
Cambridge has orally, and by the pen, become
influential wherever these subjects are represented.
There is not an educational institute in
Great Britain or in the colonies, there is not a
serious magazine or review on which it has not
set its seal. We have a striking illustration of
this in the case of Modern History. Some thirty
years ago it was practically unrepresented,
either at Oxford or Cambridge. Since then its
study has been organized. What has been the
result? It has become one of the most flourishing
branches of learning. It has reduced chaos
to order; it has raised its teaching, and by
implication its literature, to a very high standard;
it has put the <i>canaille</i> of sciolists and
fribbles into their proper place; while disciplining
energy it has directed it to fruitful objects;
it has revolutionized the study of the whole
subject.</p>

<p>Thus the condition and fortune of everything
which is affected by education depend on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38" href="#Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Universities. All that they do, or neglect to do,
passes into precedent. There is nothing susceptible
of educational impression which does
not take its colour and its characteristics from
them. They have made the subjects which are
represented in their schools what they are, and
every intelligent English citizen proud and
grateful.</p>

<p>But, owing to a disastrous confusion between
two branches of study which are radically and
essentially distinct,—Philology and Belles Lettres,—both
Oxford and Cambridge have not only
left unorganized, but assisted in the degradation
of studies, which are of as much concern, and
vital concern, to national life as any which are
represented in their Schools. To leave an important
department of education unrecognised
in their system, is sufficient cause for surprise
and regret; but that they should be doing all in
their power to prevent any possibility of such a
defect being supplied is deplorable. And yet
this is what is being done. That Chairs, Schools
and Degrees may be established in the interests
of Philology, Philology is, by a palpable fiction,
identified with Literature. As the result of what
the late Professor Huxley denounced as "a fraud
upon letters," a Chair founded in the interests of
Literature was at Oxford appropriated by the
philologists. This has been followed by the establishment
of a School, in which all that can
provide for the honour of Philology is blended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39" href="#Page_39">[39]</a></span>
with all that contributes to the degradation of
Literature; while, to give further currency and
authority to this absurd complication, the approval
of a thesis, on some subject pertaining
purely to Philology, entitles the writer to the
diploma, not of a Doctor in Philology, but of a
Doctor in Literature!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, to make confusion worse confounded,
the Universities, or, to speak more
correctly, a party in the Universities, are undertaking
to provide the country with teachers
for the dissemination of literary culture,—for
the interpretation of Literature in the proper
sense of the term. Whether this is done competently
or incompetently depends, of course,
and must depend purely on accident, on the willingness
and ability, that is to say, of individual
teachers to educate themselves. Common standards
and common aims they have none. Each
does what is right in his own eyes. As some
have graduated in the classical schools, some in
the Mediæval and Modern Languages Tripos,
some in Modern History, some in Moral Science
or Theology, and some in nothing, there is
naturally much variety in their methods and
aims.</p>

<p>But it is when we turn to the works in
modern Belles Lettres, and more particularly
to those dealing with English Literature, which
the University Presses publish, that we realize
the full significance of this anarchy. It would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40" href="#Page_40">[40]</a></span>
not be going too far to say, that all which is
worst in current literature, when at its worst
finds in some of these works comprehensive
illustration. It is indeed almost an even chance
whether a work issuing from those Presses is
excellent, whether it is indifferent, or whether
it is executed with shameful incompetence.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>All, therefore, so far as Belles Lettres are concerned
is chaos at the Universities, and all consequently
is chaos everywhere else.</p>

<p>The next appeal—for all appeals to the Universities
have been vain—must be made to those
who regulate the curriculums where Literature
is made a subject of teaching. Let them rigorously
exclude all but the best books. Let them
discourage the study of such Epitomes, Manuals,
and Histories as are the work of mere irresponsible
book makers, and prescribe in its
place the study of literary masterpieces. Without
excluding the best modern poetry and prose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41" href="#Page_41">[41]</a></span>
let most attention—for obvious reasons—be
paid to the writings of the older masters. Let
them lay special stress on the study of criticism,—of
works treating of its principles, of works
illustrating the application of its principles to
particular writers; and let no work be recognised
which is not of classical authority. Translations
should, of course, as a rule, be avoided;
but in such a subject as the principles of
criticism, there is not the smallest reason why
those works which are most excellent in other
languages, such as the <i>Treatise on the Sublime</i>,
and some portions of Aristotle's <i>Poetic</i>, such as
Lessing's <i>Laocoon</i>, Schiller's <i>Letters on Æsthetics</i>,
the best Essays of Sainte-Beuve should not
be included.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Nor can it be emphasized too
strongly that the theory on which all literary
teaching should proceed is that its object is not
so much to plant as to cultivate, not so much to
convey information, which, after all, is but its
medium, as to inspire, to refine, to elevate. I
cannot but think, too, that the foundations of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42" href="#Page_42">[42]</a></span>
all this might be laid much earlier than they
are, especially in our classical schools, by
encouraging, as, according to Coleridge, Dr.
Boyer used to do, the study of some of our
greater writers, such as Shakespeare and Milton,
side by side with that of Homer and Sophocles.</p>

<p>But it is in criticism, in criticism competently,
honestly, and fearlessly applied, that
the chief salvation lies. There is probably
no review or newspaper in London which
does not number among its contributors men
of the first order of ability and intelligence,
men who are real scholars and real critics,
men who see through all that I have been
describing and are sick of it. Let them not
remain an impotent minority, but combine,
and become influential. If popular Literature
aspires to be ambitious, and trespasses on the
domains of scholarship and criticism, let them
submit it to the tests which it invites, let
them try it by the standards which it exacts.
There is no more reason for the co-existence
of two standards, as is now practically the
case, in the production of writings treating of
our own Literature than there is in the production
of writings dealing with Classical Literature.
The work of any one who meddles with
the last, even in the way of popularizing it, is
instantly called by scholars to a strict account,
and sciolism and charlatanry are exploded at
once. But in the case of our own Literature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43" href="#Page_43">[43]</a></span>
there is no such solidarity. It seems to be
assumed that a scholar is one thing and a man
of letters another, that the difference between
work which appeals to connoisseurs and work
which appeals to the public is not simply a
difference in degree, but a difference in kind,
and that the criteria of the multitude need be
the only criteria of what is addressed to the
multitude. The manuscript of a History of
Greek or Roman Literature, or a monograph
on an ancient classic, if it were not at least
solid and trustworthy, would have no chance
of ever getting beyond a publisher's reader.
But a History of English Literature, or a monograph
on an English classic, teeming with
errors in fact and with absurdities in theory
and opinion, will not improbably be regarded
as an authority, and pass, unrevised, into more
than one edition.</p>

<p>The progressive degradation of Literature and
of what is involved in its influence is, and must
be, inevitable, unless criticism is prepared watchfully
and faithfully to do its duty. Let it guard
jealously the standards and touchstones of excellence
as distinguished from mediocrity, even
though it may be prudent to make great allowances
in applying them; let it institute a
rigorous censorship over books designed for the
use of students at the Universities and in other
educational establishments; let it permit no
writer to pose in a false position, and deliberately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44" href="#Page_44">[44]</a></span>
trade on the ignorance and inexperience
of his readers; let it discourage in every way
the production of worthless and superfluous
books, whether in poetry or in prose; and
lastly, while fully recognising how much must
be conceded to professional authors writing
against time, having to court popularity or
being fettered by conditions imposed on them
by their employers, let it take care that their
productions shall at least not be mischievous,
either by disseminating error or by corrupting
taste.</p>

</a>ENGLISH LITERATURE AT THE UNIVERSITIES</h2>

<h3>I. LANGUAGE <i>VERSUS</i> LITERATURE AT OXFORD</h3>


<p>To say that the anarchy which has resulted
from confusing the distinction between the
study and interpretation of Literature as the
expression of art and genius, and its study and
interpretation as a mere monument of language,
has had a most disastrous effect on education
generally, would be to state very imperfectly
the truth of the case. It has led to inadequate
and even false conceptions of what constitutes
Literature. It has led to all that is of essential
importance in literary study being ignored, and
all that is of secondary or accidental interest
being preposterously magnified; to the substitution
of grammatical and verbal commentary for
the relation of a literary masterpiece to history,
to philosophy, to æsthetics; to the mechanical
inculcation of all that can be imparted, as it
has been acquired, by cramming, for the intelligent
application of principles to expression. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46" href="#Page_46">[46]</a></span>
has led to the severance of our Literature from
all that constitutes its vitality and virtue as an
active power, and from all that renders its
development and peculiarities intelligible as a
subject of historical study. In a word, it has
led to a total misconception of the ends at which
literary instruction should aim, as well as of its
most appropriate instruments and methods. All
this is illustrated nowhere more strikingly than
in the publications of the two great University
Presses. It would be easy to point to editions
of English classics, and to works on English
Literature, bearing the <i>imprimatur</i> of Oxford
and Cambridge, in which all that is worst in the
opposite extremes of pedantry and dilettantism
finds ludicrous expression.</p>

<p>And in thus speaking we are saying nothing
more than is notorious, nothing more than is
admitted, and admitted unreservedly, in the
Universities themselves, or at least at Oxford.
But different sections of Academic society regard
the matter in different lights. The majority of
the classical professors and teachers, deprecating
any attempt on the part of the University to
meddle with "Literature," treat the whole thing
as a joke, and, so far from supposing that
the reputation of the University is concerned,
find infinite amusement in the constant exposures
which are being made in the reviews
and newspapers of the absurdities of the "English
Literature party." They regard the "study<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47" href="#Page_47">[47]</a></span>
of Literature" precisely as they regard the University
Extension Movement—the one as a contemptible
excrescence on our Academic system,
the other as a contemptible excrescence on
Academic curricula. Another section takes a
very different view. Recognising the reasonableness
of the appeals which have, during the
last twelve years, been made to Oxford to place
the study of Literature on the same sound footing
as she has placed that of other subjects included
in her courses, and discerning clearly that what
is required cannot be obtained as long as the
interests of Philology and those of Literature
continue to collide, this party, unhappily a small
minority, has pleaded for the establishment of a
School of Literature. They have very properly
laid stress on four points: First, that, as the chief
justification for the establishment of such a School
is the fact that the University is undertaking by
innumerable agencies, its Press, its oral teachers
both at home and abroad, to disseminate liberal
instruction through the medium of English
Literature, the principal object of the School
should be the education of these agencies.
Secondly, they have insisted that, if the interpretation
of Literature is to effect what it is of
power to effect, if, as an instrument of political
instruction, it is to warn, to admonish, to
guide, if, as an instrument of moral and æsthetic
instruction, it is to exercise that influence on
taste, on tone, on sentiment, on opinion, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48" href="#Page_48">[48]</a></span>
character—on all, in short, which is susceptible
of educational impression—it must both be
properly defined and liberally studied; and they
contend that, if it is to be so defined and so
studied outside the Universities, it must first be
so defined and so studied within. Thirdly, they
insist that the study of our own Literature
should be associated with that of ancient classical
literature, for two indisputable reasons: first,
because the basis of all liberal literary culture, of a
high standard, must necessarily rest on competent
classical attainments, and because, historically
speaking, the development and characteristics of
the greater part of what is most valuable in our
Literature would be as unintelligible, without
reference to the Greek and Roman classics, as the
Literature of Rome would be without reference
to that of Greece. Fourthly, they point out that,
as our Literature is, in various intimate ways,
associated with the Literatures of Italy, France,
and Germany, and that, as an acquaintance
with the classics of those countries must form
an essential element in a literary education, the
comparative study of those Literatures and our
own ought, by all means, to be encouraged and
provided for. And, fifthly, they show that what
is demanded is perfectly feasible. There already
exists in the University, they contend, every
facility for organizing such a course of Literature
as is required. All that is needed is co-ordination.
In the Classical Moderations and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49" href="#Page_49">[49]</a></span>
the <i>Literæ Humaniores</i> Honour Schools a liberal
literary education on the classical side is already
provided; two-thirds in fact of the discipline,
culture, and attainments desiderated in a literary
teacher it is the aim of those Schools to impart.
The Taylorian Institute provides instruction in
the languages and literatures of the Continent;
and, if its professors could be roused into a little
more activity, a youth might, in two years, if he
pleased,—and that side by side with his severer
studies—acquire something more than a superficial
acquaintance with the language and writings
of Dante and Machiavelli, of Montaigne and
Molière, of Lessing and Goethe. What he could
not obtain would be instruction and guidance in
the study of our own Literature. In a word, all
that is required to secure what this party plead
for is simply the establishment of a School of
English Literature, in the proper acceptation of
the term, and the co-ordination of studies which
are at present pursued independently. It was
proposed that it should take the form of a Post-graduate
Honour School, standing in the same
relation to the other schools in the University
as the old Law and History School used to stand
to the old <i>Literæ Humaniores</i> School, and as the
examination for the Bachelorship in Civil Law
now stands to the ordinary Law School. Thus
a youth who had graduated in honours in
Moderations and in the Final Classical School,
who had studied modern literatures at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50" href="#Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Taylorian and our own Literature under its
professor, or even by himself, would have an
opportunity of displaying his qualifications for
an honour diploma in Literature. But the
appeals and arguments of this party have been
of no avail.</p>

<p>Next come the philologists. They are in
possession of the field. All the revenues supporting
the Chairs of Language and Literature
are their monopoly. They have steadily resisted
all attempts on the part of what may be denominated
the Liberal party to encroach on their
dominions. In their eyes the Universities are
simply nurseries for esoteric specialists, and to
talk of bringing them into touch with national
life is, in their estimation, mere cant. Their
attitude towards Literature, generally, is precisely
that of the classical party towards our own
Literature; they regard it simply as the concern
of men of letters, journalists, dilettants,
and Extension lecturers. They defeated sixteen
years ago an attempt to establish a Chair of
English Literature by transforming it into a
Chair of Language and securing it for themselves.
They attempted, subsequently, to supplement
what they had done by the establishment of a
School of Language on the model of the Mediæval
and Modern Languages Tripos at Cambridge.
They were defeated by a coalition of the classical
party, the Liberals, of whom we have just
spoken, and a third party which insisted on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51" href="#Page_51">[51]</a></span>
compromise between Philology and Literature.
Reviving the scheme, they have, by accepting
the modifications of the compromisers, just
succeeded in getting it accepted. The new
School of English Language and Literature is
the result of that compromise.</p>

<p>Now it will not be disputed that if the Universities
ought, in the interests of liberal culture,
to provide adequately for instruction in Literature,
they ought also, in the interests of science,
to provide adequately for instruction in Philology.
It is a branch of learning of immense importance.
It is, and ought to be, the peculiar care of
Universities, and nothing could be more derogatory
to a University than deficiency in such a
study. But it is a study in itself. As a science
it has no connection with Literature. Indeed
the instincts and faculties which separate the
temperament of the mathematician from the
temperament of the poet are not more radical
and essential than the instincts and faculties
which separate the sympathetic student of
Philology from the sympathetic student of
Literature. But no science resolves itself more
easily into a pseudo-science, and it is in this
degenerate form that it has become linked with
Literature and been, in all ages, the butt of wits
and men of letters. Nothing but anarchy can
result till this mutually degrading alliance be
dissolved. It has been forced on the philologists
by the compromise to which reference has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52" href="#Page_52">[52]</a></span>
made. Let them be free to rescind it. Let the
"pia vota" of Professor Max Müller be fulfilled
and Oxford have her School of Philology. That
such a School should be established is desirable
for three reasons. In the first place, it would
define what is at present vague and indeterminate,
the scope and functions of Philology.
Secondly, it would place that study on its
proper footing, and, by placing it on its proper
footing, it would not only demonstrate its relation
to other studies, but it would enable it
to effect fully what it is competent to effect.
Thirdly, it might, and probably would, do something
to relieve Oxford of the opprobrium of
being behind the rest of the learned world in
this branch of science. The School would probably
not attract many students, for Philology,
unlike Literature, can never appeal to more
than a small minority. If, therefore, the choice
lay between the institution of a School of Philology
and that of a School of Literature, there
can be no doubt which should have precedence.
But no such choice is offered. If the philologists
were not strong enough to refuse to compromise,
they are strong enough to crush any attempt to
forestall them.</p>

<p>Let us now turn to the constitution of the
School which has been the result of this arrangement,
and which will authorize the University
to confer, not, be it remembered, an ordinary,
but an honour, degree in English Language and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53" href="#Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Literature. The following are the Regulations.
The subjects for examination are four. 1. Portions
of English authors. 2. The History of the
English Language. 3. The History of English
Literature. 4. In the case of those candidates
who aim at a place in the first or second class, a
Special Subject of language or literature. The
portions of the authors specified are these.
<i>Beowulf</i>, the texts printed in Sweet's <i>Anglo-Saxon
Reader</i>, <i>King Horn</i>, <i>Havelok</i>; Laurence
Minot, <i>Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</i>. Of
Chaucer's <i>Canterbury Tales</i>, the <i>Prologue</i>, <i>The
Knight's Tale</i>, <i>The Man of Law's</i>, <i>The Prioress's</i>,
<i>Sir Thopas</i>, <i>The Monk's</i>, <i>The Nun Priest's</i>, <i>The
Pardoner's</i>, <i>The Clerk's</i>, <i>The Squire's</i>, <i>The Second
Nun's</i>, <i>The Canon Yeoman's</i>. Next come the
<i>Prologue</i> and the first seven <i>passus</i> (text B) of
<i>Piers Ploughman</i>. Then come select plays of
Shakespeare, chosen apparently at haphazard,
<i>Love's Labour's Lost</i>, <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, <i>Richard
the Second</i>, <i>Twelfth Night</i>, <i>Julius Cæsar</i>, <i>Winter's
Tale</i>, <i>King Lear</i>. Then we have the following
extraordinary farrago:—</p>

<p>Bacon's <i>Essays</i>.</p>

<p>Milton, with a special study of <i>Paradise Lost</i>
and the <i>Areopagitica</i>.</p>

<p>Dryden's <i>Essay on Epic</i> (sic).</p>

<p>Pope's <i>Satires and Epistles</i>.</p>

<p>Johnson's <i>Lives of the Poets</i>—the Lives of
Eighteenth-Century Poets.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54" href="#Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>Goldsmith's <i>Citizen of the World</i>.</p>

<p>Burke's <i>Thoughts on the Present Discontents</i>.</p>

<p>Lyrical Ballads (Wordsworth and Coleridge),
Shelley's <i>Adonais</i>.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The second part of the examination will be on
the History of the English Language. "Candidates
will be examined in Gothic (the Gospel of
St. Mark), and in translation from Old English
and Middle English authors not specially
offered."</p>

<p>This is to be followed by the History of English
Literature, to which portion of the Regulations
the following odd clause is appended:
"the examination will include the History of
Criticism and of style in prose and verse."
Last come the special subjects designed for
"those who aim at a place in the First or
Second Class." Six of these consist of certain
prescribed periods of English Literature. The
other subjects are as follows:—</p>

<p>(1) Old English Language and Literature
down to 1150 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span></p>

<p>(2) Middle English Language and Literature,
1150-1400 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span></p>

<p>(3) Old French Philology with special reference
to Anglo-Norman French, together with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55" href="#Page_55">[55]</a></span>
special study of the following texts:—<i>Computus
of Phillippe de Thaun</i>, <i>Voyage of St. Brandan</i>,
<i>The Song of Dermot and the Earl</i>, <i>Les Contes
moralisés de Nicole Bozon</i>.</p>

<p>(4) Scandinavian Philology, with special reference
to Icelandic, together with a special study
of the following texts:—<i>Gylfaginning</i>, <i>Laxdæla
Saga</i>, <i>Gunnlaugssaga Ormstungu</i>.</p>

<p>(5) French Literature down to 1400 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> in its
bearing on English Literature.</p>

<p>(6) Italian Literature as influencing English
down to the death of Milton.</p>

<p>(7) German Literature from 1500 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> to the
death of Goethe in its bearing on English Literature.</p>

<p>(8) History of Scottish Poetry.</p>

<p>Such is the scheme which will, in conjunction
with the similar scheme at Cambridge, supply
England and the colonies with their literary professors.
Let us examine it in detail. The first
thing which strikes us is the contrast between
the competence and judgment displayed in the
organization of the philological part of the
course and the confusion, inadequacy, and flimsiness
so conspicuous in the literary part. Nothing
could be more satisfactory than the provisions
made for the study of Language. They are obviously
the work of legislators who knew what
they were about, and who, but for the thwarting
requirements of the provisions for Literature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56" href="#Page_56">[56]</a></span>
would have proceeded to a superstructure worthy
of the foundation. A student who, in addition
to having mastered the prescribed works in
Gothic, Anglo-Saxon, and Middle English, is
competent to translate and comment on unprepared
passages from those dialects, has certainly
laid the foundation of sound scholarship in an
important department of Philology. In the fact
that what properly belongs to his study has been
relegated to the subjects out of which he has
only the option of choosing one, we have a
lamentable illustration of the effects of the compromise
forced on the philologists. If, for the
literary portion of the curriculum, a candidate
could substitute the first four of the special subjects,
he would have completed a thoroughly
satisfactory course of Philology, so far at least as
relates to the Teutonic and Romance languages.</p>

<p>But to pass from what concerns Philology to
what concerns Literature. Now in considering
this point it is necessary to remember that we
are not dealing with the regulations of any subordinate
institution or curriculum, with provincial
Universities and seminaries, or with schemes
of study in which Literature is only one out of
many subjects. We are dealing with a Final
Honour School at Oxford, with regulations which
will inevitably form a precedent and model
wherever the study of English literature shall
be organized in Great Britain. We are dealing
with a school which is to educate those who are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57" href="#Page_57">[57]</a></span>
to educate the country. Nothing, therefore,
could be more disastrous than unsoundness and
deficiency in the provisions of such an institution,
nothing more deplorable than its giving
countenance and authority to error and inadequacy.
It is not too much to say that, if this
scheme had been designed with the express object
of degrading the standard of literary teaching,
and of perpetuating all that is worst in
present systems, it could hardly have been better
adapted for its purpose. Not to dwell upon subordinate
defects, it completely severs the study
of our own literature from that of the ancient
classical literatures. It necessitates no knowledge
of any of the Continental literatures. It
ignores absolutely the higher criticism. Contracting
Literature within the narrowest bounds,
its selection of books for special study is worthy
of an Army Examination. In the wretched
jumble in which Goldsmith's <i>Citizen of the World</i>
jostles Shelley's <i>Adonais</i> and Burke's <i>Thoughts
on the Present Discontents</i> Wordsworth's and
Coleridge's <i>Lyrical Ballads</i>, no attempt is made
to discriminate between compositions which are
representative, either critically of the work of
particular authors, or historically of particular
epochs, and works which have no such significance,
while many of the most important departments
of our prose Literature are unrepresented.
Nor is this all. It affords every facility for
cramming. It is adapted to test nothing but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58" href="#Page_58">[58]</a></span>
what may be mechanically acquired and mechanically
imparted, what may be poured out
from lectures into notebooks, and from notebooks
into examination papers. Proceeding on
the assumption that a literary education is
merely the acquisition of positive knowledge, it
neither requires nor encourages, as the prescription
of an essay or thesis, or even "taste-paper,"
might have done, any of the finer qualities of
literary culture, such, for example, as a sense of
style, sound judgment, good taste, the touch of
the scholar. We can assure these legislators,
and we speak from knowledge, that, setting
aside the philological portion of this curriculum,
which is, so far as it goes, solid enough, an experienced
crammer, would, in about three months
furnish an astute youth with all that is requisite
for graduating in this school.</p>

<p>But to proceed to details. Conceive the qualifications
of an interpreter and critic of English
Literature, a graduate in Honours in his subject,
whose education has proceeded on the hypothesis
that he need have no acquaintance with the
classics of Greece and Rome. Would any competent
scholar deny that the history of English
Literature, in its mature expression, is little less
than the history of the modifications of native
genius and characteristics by classical influence,
that the development and peculiarities of our
epic, dramatic, elegiac, didactic, pastoral, much
of our lyric, of our satire and of other species of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59" href="#Page_59">[59]</a></span>
our poetry is, historically speaking, unintelligible
without reference to ancient classical literature?
That what is true of our poetry is true of our
criticism, of our oratory, sacred and secular, of
our dialectic and epistolary Literature, of our
historical composition, of the greater part, in
short, of our national masterpieces in prose?
What, indeed, the Literature of Greece was to
that of Rome, the Literatures of Greece and
Rome have been to ours.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>It was the influence of Æschylus, Sophocles,
Euripides, Menander, Diphilus, which transformed
the <i>Ludi Scenici</i> and the Atellan farces
into the tragedies of Ennius and Pacuvius and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60" href="#Page_60">[60]</a></span>
the comedies of Plautus and Terence. It was
the influence of the Roman drama and of a
drama modelled on the Roman which transformed,
so far at least as structure and style are
concerned, our similarly rude native experiments
into the tragedies and comedies of Shakespeare.
On the epics of Greece were modelled the epics
of Rome, and on the epics of Greece and Rome
are modelled our own great epics. Of our
elegiac poetry, to employ the term in its conventional
sense, one portion is largely indebted to
Theocritus, Moschus, and Virgil, and another to
Catullus and Ovid. Almost all our didactic
poetry is modelled on the didactic poetry of
Rome. Theocritus and Virgil have furnished
the archetypes for our eclogues and pastorals.
One important branch of our lyric poetry springs
directly from Pindar, another important branch
directly from Horace, another directly from the
choral odes of the Attic dramatists and of Seneca.
Our heroic satire, from Hall to Lord Lytton, is
simply the counterpart—often, indeed, a mere
imitation—of Roman satire. And if this is true
of our satire, it is equally true of our best
ethical poetry. The Epistles, which fill so large
a space in the poetical literature of the seventeenth
and eighteenth century, derive their
origin from those of Horace. To the <i>Heroides</i>
of Ovid we owe a whole series of important
poems from Drayton to Cawthorn. The
Greek anthology and Martial have furnished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61" href="#Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the archetypes of our epigrams and of our epitaphs.
It is the same with our prose. The
history of English eloquence begins from the
moment when the Roman classics moulded and
coloured our style, when periodic prose was
modelled on Cicero and Livy, when analytic
prose was modelled on Sallust, Seneca, and
Tacitus. With the exception of fiction, there
is no important branch of our prose composition,
the development and characteristics of which are
historically intelligible without reference to the
ancients. How radically inadequate must any
study of the principles of criticism be, which has
no reference to the critical works of the Greek
and Roman writers, is obvious. But it is not
merely in tracing the development and explaining
the peculiarities generally of our prose and of
our poetry that competent classical scholarship is
indispensable. Is it not notorious that in each
generation, from Spenser to Tennyson, from
More to Froude, our leading poets and prose
writers have been, with very few exceptions,
men nourished on classical literature and saturated
with its influence? Many entire masterpieces,
much, and in some cases the greater
portion, of other masterpieces, particularly in
our poetry, are simply unintelligible—we are
speaking, of course, of serious critical students—except
to classical scholars. Take, for example,
the <i>Faerie Queen</i>, and the <i>Hymns</i> of
Spenser, Milton's <i>Paradise Lost</i>, <i>Comus</i>, <i>Lycidas</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62" href="#Page_62">[62]</a></span>
and <i>Samson Agonistes</i>, Pope's satires, the two
great odes of Gray, Collins's odes to <i>Fear</i> and
the <i>Passions</i>, Wordsworth's great <i>Ode</i> and his
<i>Laodamia</i>, Shelley's <i>Adonais</i> and <i>Prometheus
Unbound</i>, Landor's <i>Hellenics</i>, much of the poetry
of Tennyson, Browning, and Matthew Arnold.
Indeed it would be as preposterous to attempt
any critical study of our Literature, without reference
to the ancients, as it would be for a man to
set up as an interpreter in Roman Literature
without reference to the Greek.</p>

<p>And the effect of this severance of the study of
the ancient classics from the study of our own is
written large throughout the whole domain of
education, in the instruction given in schools and
institutes, in the monographs, manuals, and "editions"
which pour from scholastic presses. In one
of the most popular manuals now in circulation,
the writer gravely tells us that "the pastoral name
of <i>Lycidas</i> was chosen by Milton to signify purity
of character," adding "in Theocritus a goat was
so called <ins title="leukitas">λευκιτας</ins> for its whiteness," that Comus
"the drinker of human blood" revelled in the
palace of Agamemnon.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Another writer confounds
the "choruses" in Shakespeare with the
choruses of the Greek plays. Another, commenting
on the symbolism of ivy in the wreath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63" href="#Page_63">[63]</a></span>
of a poet, tells us that it indicates "constancy."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
Nothing is more common than to find elaborate
critical comments on the <i>Faerie Queen</i> without
the smallest reference to its connection with
Aristotle's <i>Ethics</i>, and on Wordsworth's great
<i>Ode</i> without any reference to Plato. But such
is the confidence reposed in Professor Earle and
his theory, and so determined are the legislators
for the new School to exclude all connection
with classical literature, that it is not admitted
even as a special subject. A candidate has, as we
have seen, the option of studying the influence
exercised on old English literature by French,
and on later literature by Italian and German;
but the one thing which he has not the option of
studying is the influence exercised on it by the
literatures of Greece and Rome. Some of our
readers may remember that a few years ago a
public appeal was made for an expression of
opinion on the question of associating the study
of our own classics and that of the ancients.
Opinions were elicited from many of the most distinguished
men in England. They were all but
unanimous, not merely in supporting the association,
but in deprecating the severance. So wrote
Mr. Gladstone, Cardinal Manning, Professor
Jowett, Matthew Arnold, Lord Lytton, Mr. John
Morley, Walter Pater, <a name="Correct3" id="Correct3">Addington Symonds</a>; so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64" href="#Page_64">[64]</a></span>
wrote the Archbishop of Canterbury and the
Bishop of London, the Rector of Lincoln, the
President of Magdalen, the Warden of All Souls,
and many others. We may add, also—for we
are now at liberty to state it publicly—that this
was emphatically the opinion of Robert Browning.
We cannot, of course, quote these opinions
<i>in extenso</i>,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and that of the late Professor
Jowett and a portion of that of Mr. John
Morley must suffice.</p>

<blockquote><p>I am as strongly of opinion that in an Honour School of
English Literature or Modern Literature the subject should
not be separated from classical literature, as I am of opinion
that English literature should have a place in our curriculum.</p></blockquote>

<p>So writes Professor Jowett.</p>

<blockquote><p>It seems to me to be as impossible effectively to study
English literature, except in close association with the
classics, as it would be to grasp the significance of mediæval
or modern institutions without reference to the political
creations of Greece and Rome. I should be very sorry to see
the study of Greek and Latin writers displaced, or cut off
from the study of our own.</p></blockquote>

<p>So writes Mr. John Morley.</p>

<p>But the Professor of Anglo-Saxon and his
friends, as we have seen, think otherwise, and
have, unhappily for the interests of letters and
education, persuaded Oxford to think otherwise
too. We say advisedly the interests of letters and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65" href="#Page_65">[65]</a></span>
education. For the precedent of excluding from
a School of "Literature," and that at the chief
centre and nursery of liberal culture, the Literatures
of Greece and Rome cannot but be detrimental
to the vitality and influence of the ancient
classics; and, as Froude truly observed, both the
national taste and the tone of the national intellect
would suffer serious decline, if they lost their
authority. The reaction against philological
study which has set in during the last ten years
has given them a new lease of life. But the
spirit of the age is against them; they have
rivals in languages far easier to acquire; they
are not, and never can be, in touch with the
many. Let them become disassociated from our
curriculums of Literature, and they will cease
to be influential, They will cease to be studied
seriously, to be studied even in the original,
except by mere scholars.</p>

<p>Another absurdity, not less monstrous, in these
regulations, is the absence of all provision for instruction
in the principles of criticism. There
is indeed an unmeaning clause about the history
of criticism, and of style in verse and prose,
being included in the examination; but as nothing
is specified, and as no work on criticism,
with the exception of Dryden's <i>Discourse on
Epic Poetry</i>, and Johnson's <i>Lives</i> (of eighteenth-century
poets),<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> is included in the books<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66" href="#Page_66">[66]</a></span>
prescribed for special study, it is plain that this
important subject has no place. Why it should
not have occurred to these legislators to substitute,
say, for Goldsmith's <i>Citizen of the World</i>
and Burke's <i>Thoughts on the Present Discontents</i>,
some work which would at least have opened
the eyes of the literary professors of the future
to the existence of philosophical criticism, is
certainly odd. Had they prescribed select
essays from Hume; and Shaftesbury's <i>Advice
to an Author</i>, or Campbell's <i>Philosophy of
Rhetoric</i>, or Burke's <i>Treatise on the Sublime
and Beautiful</i>, or even the critical portions of
Coleridge's <i>Biographia Literaria</i>, with the two
essays of Wordsworth, it would have been
something. But the truth is that, as they have
excluded, except from the optional subjects, all
literatures but the English, one absurdity has
involved them in another. The course for the
literary education of our future professors,
proceeding on the principle that they need
know no language but Gothic and Anglo-Saxon,
has necessitated the elimination of all the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67" href="#Page_67">[67]</a></span>
masterpieces of critical literature. As they are
assumed to know no Greek, they can have no
serious instruction in such works as Aristotle's
<i>Poetic</i> and <i>Rhetoric</i>, and in the <i>Treatise on the
Sublime</i>. As they are assumed to know no
Latin, they can have no instruction in Roman
criticism. On the same principle such works
as Lessing's <i>Laocoon</i> and <i>Hamburgische Dramaturgie</i>,
Schiller's Æsthetical Letters and Essays,
Villemain's Lectures, and Sainte-Beuve's Essays,
can find no place in their curriculum of study.
And so it comes to pass that Dryden's <i>Discourse
on Epic Poetry</i> and Johnson's <i>Lives</i> of
the eighteenth-century poets, represent—<i>proh
pudor!</i>—the course in Criticism.</p>

<p>Now it is not too much to say that, for a
University like Oxford to confer an honour
degree in English Literature on a student who
need never have read a line of the works to
which we have referred, is to authorize not simply
superficiality, but sheer imposture. How can a
teacher deal adequately even with the subject
which these regulations profess to include—the
history of criticism—who need have no acquaintance
with the <i>Poetic</i> and <i>Rhetoric</i>, the <i>Treatise
on the Sublime</i>, and the <i>Institutes of Oratory</i>?
How could a teacher possibly be a competent
exponent and critic of the masterpieces of our
literature, who had not received a proper critical
training, and how could he have any pretension
to such a training when all that is best in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68" href="#Page_68">[68]</a></span>
criticism had been expressly excluded from his
education?</p>

<p>It may be urged that he would himself supply
these deficiencies, that the study of our own
Literature would naturally lead him to the study
of other Literatures, that intelligent curiosity,
ambition, or a sense of shame would induce him
to supplement voluntarily, and by his own
efforts, what he needed in his profession. In
some instances this would undoubtedly be the
case. In the great majority of instances such
a supposition would be against all analogy. As
a general rule, a high honour degree in any
subject represented at the Universities is final.
It winds a man up for life. It determines, fixes,
and colours his methods, his views, his tone, in
all that relates to the subject in which he has
graduated. If he chooses teaching as a profession,
he has no inducement to correct, to
modify, or even materially add to what has
been imparted to him, for his scholastic reputation
has been made, and a comfortable independence
is assured. To very many men, indeed,
who go up to the Universities with the intention
of following teaching as a profession, a
high degree is a mere investment, the one
instinct in them which is not quite banausic
being the conscientious thoroughness with
which they impart what they have been taught.
Nothing, therefore, is of more importance to
education than the sound constitution of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69" href="#Page_69">[69]</a></span>
Honour Schools of Oxford and Cambridge, and
nothing could be more disastrous than the
toleration in those Schools of inadequate
standards, and of palpably erroneous theories
of study.</p>

<p>But to return to the Regulations. The ridiculous
disproportion between the ground covered
and the work involved in the different "special
subjects" open to the option of candidates, would
seem to indicate, either that the regulators are
very inadequately informed on those subjects, or
that divided counsels have resulted in the settlement
of very different standards of requirement.
Compare, for instance, what is involved respectively
in such subjects as "English Literature
between 1700 and 1745," and "The History of
Scottish Poetry." Why, a competent knowledge
of the history of Scotch poetry in the
fifteenth century alone would be more than
an equivalent to the first subject. Not less
absurd is the prescription of "English Literature
between 1745 and 1797" as an alternative
for "English Literature between 1558 and 1637."
The prescription of such "special subjects" as
the influence exercised on our Literature by the
Literatures of Italy, Germany, and France, is
one of the few steps in a wise direction discernible
in these regulations; but, as no student is
free to take more than one of them, or required
to take any of them at all, their inclusion in no
way affects the constitution of the School. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70" href="#Page_70">[70]</a></span>
competent literary education is not very much
furthered by a student being invited to study
how our Literature has been affected by one
out of the five Literatures which have influenced
it. As, moreover, the integrity of a chain
depends on its weakest link, so the efficiency
of examinational tests, in their application to
purely optional subjects, depends on that subject
in the list which involves least labour. A
candidate who can "get a first" out of "English
Literature between 1700 and 1745," or between
1745 and 1797, will be much too wise to attempt
to "get a first" out of subjects which will
require treble the time and labour to master.
Is it likely that candidates, anxious, naturally,
from less lofty motives than the love of Literature
for its own sake, to obtain an honour degree,
will, after laboriously acquiring Anglo-Saxon
and Middle English, which are compulsory,
voluntarily specialize in a subject requiring a
knowledge of Italian and German, when it is
open to them to choose, as their special subject,
"Old English Language and Literature down to
1150"?</p>

<p>The statute authorizing the foundation of this
School recites that in its curriculum and examinations
"equal weight" is, "as far as possible,
to be given to Language and Literature, provided
always that candidates who offer special subjects
shall be at liberty to choose subjects connected
either with Language or Literature, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71" href="#Page_71">[71]</a></span>
with both." It would be interesting to know
what this means. If by "equal weight" be
meant equality in the proportions of what is
prescribed for the study of Literature, and what
is prescribed for the study of Language, the provision
is stultified by the very constitution of the
course. To suppose that the history of English
Literature, and the special study of a few particular
works like Shelley's <i>Adonais</i>, Burke's
<i>Present Discontents</i>, and the <i>Lyrical Ballads</i>, is
equivalent to the History of the English language,
the Gospel of St. Mark in Gothic, the <i>Beowulf</i>,
and a volume of extracts in Anglo-Saxon, <i>King
Horn</i>, <i>Havelok</i>, <i>Sir Gawain</i>, and the prologue
and seven <i>passus</i> of <i>Piers Ploughman</i> in Middle
English, is palpably absurd. If by "equal
weight" be meant that an examiner is to assign
equal marks to candidates who distinguish themselves
in Literature, and to candidates who distinguish
themselves in Language, it involves
gross injustice. For while the latter have every
opportunity for displaying knowledge and competence,
the former have not. If a student has
literary tastes and sympathies, if he is conversant
with the Classics, if, attracted by what is best
not merely in our own but in other modern Literatures,
he has indulged himself in their study,
if he has made himself a good critic and acquired
a good style, what chance has he of doing his
attainments and accomplishments justice? But
if it be meant that "equal weight" will be given,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72" href="#Page_72">[72]</a></span>
not to literary merit regarded as Sainte-Beuve
and Matthew Arnold would regard it, but regarded
in relation to the standard indicated by
the regulations of the School, then the philologists
would have just reason to complain.</p>

<p>As the constitution of this School is still open
to amendment, it is devoutly to be hoped that
Oxford will see its way to reconsidering a matter
so seriously affecting the interests of education
and culture. It is neither too late to remedy
what has been done, nor to devise a remedy.
Let it be remembered that there is an essential
distinction between what should constitute an
Honour School and what should constitute a Pass
School, between what is to educate those who
are to educate others, and what guarantees
nothing more than a smattering. The present
institution could be reformed in two ways. By
reducing the philological part of its provisions
to the level of the literary part, it could, with a
little further simplification, be made into an
excellent Pass School, which would supply a real
want. By eliminating the literary part, and
adding proportionately to the philological, it
could be transformed into a perfectly satisfactory
Honour School of Modern Languages. But
no modification could make it into an Honour
School of English Literature correspondingly
adequate, for the simple reason that the study
of English Literature cannot be isolated from
the study of those literatures with which it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73" href="#Page_73">[73]</a></span>
inseparably linked. The absurdity of assuming
that the student of Philology could separate a
single language or dialect from the group to
which it belongs, that he could isolate Anglo-Saxon
from Gothic, or Middle English from
Anglo-Saxon, the Celtic of the Cymbry from the
Celtic of the Gaels, is not greater than to assume
that the study of our Literature can be severed
from the study of those literatures which stand
in precisely the same relation to it as one of
those dialects stands to the others in the same
group.</p>

<p>If the legislators of this School decline to
reform it, then it is the duty of Oxford—a duty
which she owes alike to education and to her
own honour—to counteract the mischief which
this institution must, by degrading throughout
England and the colonies the whole level of
liberal instruction and study on its most important
side, inevitably do. To the herd of imperfectly
and erroneously disciplined teachers which
this institution will turn loose on education, let
her oppose, at least, a minority which shall
worthily represent her. Let her establish a
proper degree or diploma in Literature. There
exist, as we have already said, scattered throughout
the various institutions of the University,
nearly all the facilities for a complete course in
this subject, and nothing more is needed than to
encourage and render possible their co-ordination.
Let it be open to a man who has obtained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74" href="#Page_74">[74]</a></span>
a high class in Moderations and in the Final
Classical Schools, who has availed himself of the
opportunities offered for the study of Modern
Languages and Literatures in the Taylorian Institute,
and who has studied what he would at
present have to study for himself, our own
Literature—let it be open to him to present himself
for examination in these subjects, and to
obtain, as the result of such an examination, a
degree analogous to the Bachelorship of Civil
Law. It would no doubt not be possible for
these studies to be pursued, systematically, side
by side with the work required for a high class
in Moderations and <i>Literæ Humaniores</i>. Nor is
it necessary. There need be no limit assigned
to the time at which a candidate would be free
to qualify himself for obtaining this diploma.
As a general rule it would probably be about
six months, possibly a year, after the attainment
of the present degree in Arts. And, considering
the high prizes open to teachers in Literature, it
would be well worth a student's while to spend
this additional time in preparing himself for the
examination. If a post-graduate scholarship,
analogous to the Craven or the Derby scholarships,
could be founded for the encouragement
of a comparative study of Classical and Modern
Literature, an important step would, at any rate,
be taken in a right direction; something would
be done for the competent equipment of future
Professors of Literature.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75" href="#Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus would a precedent, disastrous beyond
expression to the interests of liberal instruction
and culture, as well as to the reputation of the
University—we mean the severance of the study
of Classical Literature from that of our own—be
at least deprived of its authority. Thus would
the mass at any rate be leavened, and such institutions
in the provinces and elsewhere as have,
unlike Oxford and Cambridge, had the wisdom
to separate their Chairs of Language and Literature,
know where to go for those who should fill
them; and thus, finally, would there be some
chance of the literary curriculum in Oxford
ceasing to be a by-word in the Universities of
the Continent and America.</p>

<blockquote><p>Since the first edition of these essays appeared the liberality
of Mr. John Passmore Edwards has supplied the scholarship
here desiderated, and Oxford has instituted a University
scholarship, bearing the donor's name, "for the encouragement
and promotion of the study of English Literature in
connection with the Classical Literatures of Greece and
Rome."</p></blockquote>

as the watchword of a pedantic faction, and hardly
any organ of current literature has proved itself strong

of Latin on the Board."—<i>Times</i>, May 26, 1887.</p></div>

Shelley's <i>Adonais</i>, edited with introduction and notes by
William Michael Rossetti. (Oxford: at the Clarendon Press.)</p></div>


<p>If any proof were needed of what has been
insisted on over and over again, that, until
the Universities provide adequately for the proper
study of English Literature—for the study of it
side by side with Classical Literature—there will
be small hope of its finding competent critics and
interpreters, it would be afforded by the volume
before us. For this volume the delegates of
the Oxford University Press are responsible;
and in allowing it their <i>imprimatur</i> they have
been guilty of a very grave error. No such
standard of editing would have been tolerated
in any other subject in which they undertake
to provide books. A work pertaining to
Classics, to History, to Philosophy, to Science,
marked by corresponding deficiencies, would
have been suppressed at once, until those deficiencies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77" href="#Page_77">[77]</a></span>
had been supplied. To Mr. Rossetti
himself we attach no blame. What he was
competent to do he has, for the most part, done
well and conscientiously,—conscientiously, as may
be judged from the fact that, while the poem
itself occupies twenty pages in large type, Mr.
Rossetti's dissertations and notes occupy one
hundred and twenty-eight in small type. It
was, indeed, his misfortune, rather than his fault,
to be entrusted with a work which required a
peculiar qualification, an intimate acquaintance,
that is to say, with Classical Literature. That
he has no pretension to this is abundantly plain
from his Introduction and from every page of
his notes.</p>

<p>When one of the Universities undertakes to
provide our colleges and schools with comments
and notes on a poem so saturated with classicism
as <i>Adonais</i>, the least that could be expected
from bodies who are, as it were, the guardians
of classical literature, is the provision that the
classical part of the work should be done at
least competently; it would be hardly too much,
perhaps, to expect that it should be done excellently.
Of this part of Mr. Rossetti's work we
scarcely know which are the worse—his sins of
commission or his sins of omission. His classical
qualifications for commenting on a poem as unintelligible,
critically speaking, without constant
reference to the Platonic dialogues, particularly
to the <i>Symposium</i> and the <i>Timæus</i>, and to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78" href="#Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Greek poets, as the <i>Æneid</i> would be without
reference to the Homeric poems and the <i>Argonautica</i>
of Apollonius, appear to begin and end
with some acquaintance with Mr. Lang's version
of Bion and Moschus. We will give a few specimens.
Mr. Rossetti is greatly puzzled with
Shelley's allusion to Urania in stanzas 2 to 4.</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i2">"Where was lone Urania</div>
<div class="i0">When Adonais died?"</div>
<br />
<div class="i0">"Most musical of mourners, weep again.</div>
<div class="i0">Lament, anew, Urania!"</div>
</div></div>

<p>"Why out of the nine sisters," he asks, "should
the Muse of Astronomy be selected? Keats
never wrote about astronomy." Perhaps, he
suggests, Shelley was not thinking of the Muse
Urania, "but of Aphrodite Urania." Yet, if so,
why should she be called "musical"?—a question
to be asked, no doubt, as our old friend Falstaff
would say. However, after balancing the
respective claims of both, he finally comes to the
conclusion that the Urania of <i>Adonais</i> is Aphrodite.
If Mr. Rossetti had been acquainted with
a work to which he never even refers, but which
exercised immense influence over Shelley's poem—the
<i>Symposium</i> of Plato—it would have saved
him two pages of speculation. His ignorance of
this is the more surprising as Shelley has himself
translated the dialogue. But Mr. Rossetti
need not, in this case, have gone so far afield.
Has he never read the prologue to the seventh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79" href="#Page_79">[79]</a></span>
book of Milton's <i>Paradise Lost</i>? In his note on
the lines—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"The one remains, the many change and pass,"</div>
</div></div>

<p>it is really pitiable to find him supposing that
this is an allusion to "the universal mind," and
"the individuated minds which we call human
beings," when any schoolboy could have told
him that the allusion is, of course, a technical
one to the Platonic "forms" or archetypes;
while "the power" in stanza 42, the "sustaining
love" in stanza 54, and the "one spirit" in
stanza 43, are allusions respectively to the
Aphrodite Urania in the discourse of Eryximachus
in the <i>Symposium</i>, and to the Divine
Artificer in the <i>Timæus</i>. And these dialogues
form the proper commentary on Shelley's metaphysics
in this poem.</p>

<p>Still more extraordinary is Mr. Rossetti's note
on "wisdom the mirrored shield"—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i4">"What was then</div>
<div class="i0">Wisdom, the mirrored shield?"</div>
</div></div>

<p>(st. 27), which is as follows: "Shelley was, I
apprehend, thinking of the <i>Orlando Furioso</i> of
Ariosto (!). In that poem we read of a magic
shield which casts a supernatural and intolerable
splendour ... a sea monster, not a dragon,
so far as I recollect, becomes one of the victims
of the mirrored shield." This slovenly and perfunctory
mode of reference is, we may remark in
passing, hardly the sort of thing to be expected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80" href="#Page_80">[80]</a></span>
in works issued from University Presses. We
wonder what the Universities would say to an
editor of Virgil who, in commenting on some
Homeric allusion in his author, contented himself
with observing that Virgil "is here thinking
of the <i>Iliad</i>," and, "so far as I can recollect," etc.
The reference is, we need hardly remark, not to
any magic shield in the <i>Orlando</i>, but to the
<i>scutum crystallinum</i> of Pallas Athene, as any
well-informed fourth-form schoolboy would
know. If Mr. Rossetti will turn to Bacon's
<i>Wisdom of the Ancients</i>, chap. vii., he will find
some information on this subject, which may
be of use to him, should this work run into a
second edition. Take, again, the note on the
symbolism of the flowers and cypress cone in
stanza 33:—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"His head was bound with pansies overblown,</div>
<div class="i1">And faded violets, white and pied and blue;</div>
<div class="i0">And a light spear topped with a cypress cone,</div>
<div class="i1">Round whose rude shaft dark ivy tresses grew."</div>
</div></div>

<p>Here the editor's ignorance of ancient Classical
Literature has led him into a whole labyrinth of
blunders and misconceptions. "The ivy," he
says, "indicates constancy in friendship"! Is it
credible that a Clarendon Press editor should be
ignorant that ivy—<i>doctarum hederæ præmia
frontium</i>—is the emblem of the poet? The
violet, he remarks, indicates modesty. It neither
indicates, nor can possibly indicate, anything of
the kind. Its traditional signification, deduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81" href="#Page_81">[81]</a></span>
perhaps from Pliny's remark (<i>Nat. Hist.</i>, xxi.
c. 38), that it is one of the longest-lived of
flowers, is fidelity. But the passage of which
Shelley was thinking when he wrote this stanza—a
passage to which Mr. Rossetti makes no
reference at all, was <i>Hamlet</i>, <a name="Correct1" id="Correct1">act iv. sc. 1</a>:
"There is pansies that's for thoughts.... I
would give you some violets, but they withered
all when my father died." So that it is quite possible
that the "faded violets," associated as these
flowers are with the Muses and the Graces, merely
symbolize the fading and drooping towards what
may be further symbolized in the cypress cone,—death.
We are by no means sure, however,
that the cypress cone does, as Mr. Rossetti remarks,
"explain itself." Shelley, assuming he
gave the image another application, was doubtless
thinking of Silvanus—"teneram ab radice
ferens, Silvane, cupressum," <i>Georg.</i> i. 20 (see,
too, Spenser's <i>Faerie Queene</i>, I. vi. st. 14), and
may possibly have been symbolizing his sympathy
with the genius of the woods—have been
referring to that "gazing on Nature's naked
loveliness," which he describes in stanza 31. In
any case, Mr. Rossetti has entirely misinterpreted
the meaning of the whole passage.</p>

<p>Wherever classical knowledge is required—as
it is in almost every stanza—he either gives no
note at all, or he blunders. Thus in stanza 24
he gives no note on the use of the word "secret."
In stanza 28 he has evidently not the smallest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82" href="#Page_82">[82]</a></span>
notion of the meaning of the word "obscene"
as applied to ravens. The fine adaptations from
<i>Lucretius</i> (II. 578-580) in stanza 21, and again
from II. 990-1010 in stanzas 20 and 42; the
adaptation from the <i>Agamemnon</i> (49-51) in
stanza 17; from the fragments of the <i>Polyidus</i>
of Euripides in stanza 39; from the <i>Iliad</i> (vi.
484) in stanza 34; from Theocritus, <i>Idyll.</i>, i. 66,
and Virg., <i>Ecl.</i>, x. 9-10 in stanza 2; and again
from Theocritus, <i>Idyll.</i>, i. 77 seqq., from which
the procession of the mourners is adapted, and
on which the whole architecture of the poem is
modelled—all these are alike unnoticed. Nor is
Mr. Rossetti more fortunate in explaining allusions
to passages in other literatures. The adaptation
of the sublime passage in Isaiah (xiv. 9, 10),
by which one of the finest parts of the poem
was suggested, stanzas 45 and 46; the singular
reminiscence in stanza 28:—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i5">"The vultures</div>
<div class="i0">... Whose wings rain contagion;"</div>
</div></div>

<p>of Marlowe's <i>Jew of Malta</i>, act ii. sc. 1, where he speaks of the raven
which</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"Doth shake contagion from her sable wings;"</div>
</div></div>

<p>the obvious reminiscence of Dante, <i>Inf.</i>, 44 seqq.
in stanza 44; of Shakespeare's <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>,
v. 3, which forms the proper commentary on
lines 7 and 8 of stanza 3; of none of these is
any notice taken. On many important points
of interpretation we differ <i>toto cœlo</i> from Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83" href="#Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Rossetti. The "fading splendour," for example,
in stanza 22, cannot possibly mean "fading as
being overcast by sorrow and dismay" (cf.
stanza 25), it simply means vanishing, receding
from sight—a magnificently graphic epithet.
Is Mr. Rossetti acquainted with the proleptic
use of adjectives and participles? We may add
that Mr. Rossetti has not even taken the
trouble to ascertain who was the writer of the
famous article, of which so much is said both
in the preface of the poem and in the poem
itself, but "presumes," etc. <i>Et sic omnia.</i> And
<i>sic omnia</i> it will inevitably continue to be, until
the Universities are prepared to do their duty
to education by placing the study of our
national Literature on a proper footing.</p>

<p>It is, we repeat, no reproach to Mr. Rossetti,
who has distinguished himself in more important
studies than the production of scholastic
text-books, that he should have failed in an
undertaking which happened to require peculiar
qualifications. Indeed, our respect for Mr.
Rossetti and our sense of his useful services
to Belles Lettres would have induced us to
spare him the annoyance of an exposure of
the deficiencies of this work, had it not illustrated,
so comprehensively and so strikingly, the
disastrous effects of the severance of the study
of English Literature from that of Ancient
Classical Literature at our Universities.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> <i>Shakespeare—Select Plays. Hamlet, Prince of Denmark</i>
(Oxford: at the Clarendon Press. <span class="smcap">MDCCCXC</span>.)</p></div>


<p>More than a century and a half has passed
since Pope thus expressed himself about
philologists,—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"'Tis true on words is still our whole debate,</div>
<div class="i0">Dispute of <i>Me</i> or <i>Te</i>, of <i>aut</i> or <i>at</i>,</div>
<div class="i0">To sound or sink in <i>Cano</i> O or A,</div>
<div class="i0">To give up Cicero or C or K;</div>
<div class="i0">The critic eye, that microscope of wit,</div>
<div class="i0">Sees hairs and pores, examines bit by bit;</div>
<div class="i0">How parts relate to parts or they to whole,</div>
<div class="i0">The body's harmony, the beaming soul,</div>
<div class="i0">Are things which Kuster, Burmann, Wasse shall see,</div>
<div class="i0">When man's whole frame is obvious to a <i>Flea</i>."</div>
</div></div>

<p>We need scarcely say that we have far too
much respect for Dr. Aldis Wright and for his
distinguished coadjutor to apply such a description
as this to them as individuals, for no one can
appreciate more heartily than we do their monumental
contribution to the textual criticism of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85" href="#Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Shakespeare, but we can make no such reserve
in speaking of this edition of <i>Hamlet</i>. A more
deplorable illustration, we do not say of the
subjection of Literature to Philology, for that
would very imperfectly represent the fact, but
of the absolute substitution of Philology, and
of Philology in the lowest sense of the term, for
Literature it would be impossible to imagine.
Had it been expressly designed to prove that its
editors were wholly unconscious of the artistic,
literary, and philosophical significance of Shakespeare's
masterpiece, it could scarcely have taken
a more appropriate form.</p>

<p>The volume contains 117 pages of Shakespeare's
text, printed in large type; the text is
preceded by a preface of twelve pages, and followed
by notes occupying no less than 121 pages
in very small type; so that the work of the
poet stands in pretty much the same relation to
that of his commentators as Falstaff's bread stood
to his sack. In the case of a play like <i>Hamlet</i>,
so subtle, so suggestive, so pregnant with critical
and philosophical problems of all kinds, commentary
on a scale like this might have been
quite appropriate. But in this stupendous mass
of exegesis and illustration there is, with the
exception of one short passage, literally not a
line about the play as a work of art, not a line
about its structure and architecture, about its
style, about its relations to æsthetic, about its
metaphysic, its ethic, about the character of
Hamlet, or about the character of any other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86" href="#Page_86">[86]</a></span>
person who figures in the drama. The only
indication that it is regarded in any other light
than as affording material for philological and
antiquarian discussion is a short quotation,
huddled in at the conclusion of the preface,
from Goethe's <i>Wilhelm Meister</i>, and an intimation
that "Hamlet's madness has formed the
subject of special investigation by several writers,
among others by Dr. Conolly and Sir Edward
Strachey."</p>

<p>A more comprehensive illustration of the
truth of the indictment brought against philologists
by Voltaire, Pope, Lessing, and Sainte-Beuve
than is supplied by the notes in this volume
it would be difficult to find. Dulness, of course,
may be assumed, and of mere dulness we do
not complain; but a combination of prolixity,
irrelevance, and absolute incapacity to distinguish
between what to ninety-nine persons in
every hundred must be purely useless and what
to ninety-nine persons in every hundred is the
information which they expect from a commentator,
is intolerable. We will give a few
illustrations. A plain man or a student for
examination comes to these lines:—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i2">"'Tis the sport to have the enginer</div>
<div class="i0">Hoist with his own petar;"</div></div></div>

<p>and, though he knows what the general sense is
wishes to know exactly what Shakespeare means.
He turns to the note for enlightenment, and the
enlightenment he gets is this:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87" href="#Page_87">[87]</a></span>—</p>

<blockquote><p>"<i>Enginer.</i> Changed in the quarto of 1676 to the more
modern form of engineer. Compare <i>Troilus and Cressida</i> ii.
3. 8, "Then there's Achilles a rare enginer." For a cognate
form mutiner see note on iii. 4. 83. So we have pioner for
pioneer <i>Othello</i> iii. 3. 346. <i>Hoist</i> may be the participle either
of the verb 'hoise' or 'hoist.' In the latter case it would
be the common abbreviated form for the participles of verbs
ending in a dental. <i>Petar.</i> So spelt in the quartos, and by
all editors to Johnson, who writes 'petards.' In Cotgrave
we have 'Petart: a Petard or Petarre; an Engine (made
like a bell or morter) wherewith strong gates,' etc."—</p></blockquote>

<p>And so the hungry sheep looks up and is not
fed. Again, he finds—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice,"</div></div></div>

<p>turns to the note, and reads:—</p>

<blockquote><p>"<i>Polacks.</i> The quartos have 'pollax,' the two earliest
folios read 'Pollax,' the third 'Polax,' the fourth 'Poleaxe.'
Pope read 'Polack' and Malone 'Polacks.' The word occurs
four times in <i>Hamlet</i>. For 'the sledded Polacks' Molke
reads 'his leaded pole-axe.' But this would be an anticlimax,
and the poet, having mentioned 'Norway' in the
first clause, would certainly have told us with whom the
'parle' was held."</p></blockquote>

<p>The poet Young noted how</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"Commentators each dark passage shun,</div>
<div class="i0">And hold their farthing candles to the sun."</div></div></div>

<p>The Clarendon Press editors are certainly
adepts in these accomplishments. Take one out
of a myriad illustrations. The line in Act i. sc.
2, "The dead vast and middle of the night," is
the signal for a note extending to twelve closely
printed lines. "'Tis bitter cold, and I am sick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88" href="#Page_88">[88]</a></span>
at heart," says Francisco. If any note were
needed here, it might have been devoted to
pointing out to tiros the fine subjective touch.
The note is this:—</p>

<blockquote><p>"<i>Bitter cold.</i> Here bitter is used adverbially to qualify
the adjective 'cold.' So we have 'daring hardy' in <i>Richard
II.</i> i. 3. 43. When the combination is likely to be misunderstood,
modern editors generally put a hyphen between the
two words. <i>Sick at heart.</i> So <i>Macbeth</i> v. 3. 19, 'I am sick
at heart.' We have also in <i>Love's Labour's Lost</i> ii. 1. 185,
'sick at the heart,' and <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> iii. 3. 72, 'heart-sick
groans.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>Now let us see how the poor student fares
when real difficulties occur. Every reader of
Shakespeare is familiar with the corrupt passage,
Act iv. sc. 1:—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i8">"The dram of eale</div>
<div class="i0">Doth all the noble substance of worth out</div>
<div class="i0">To his own scandal—</div></div></div>

<p>a passage which, as all Shakespearian scholars
know, has been satisfactorily emended and explained.
We turn to the notes for guidance,
and find ourselves treated as poor Mrs. Quickly
was treated by Falstaff, "fubbed off"—thus:—</p>

<blockquote><p>"We leave this hopelessly corrupt passage as it stands in
the two earliest quartos. The others read 'ease' for 'eale,'
and modern writers have conjectured for the same word
base, ill, bale, ale, evil, ail, vile, lead. For 'of a doubt' it
has been proposed to substitute 'of worth out,' 'soul with
doubt,' 'oft adopt,' 'oft work out,' 'of good out,' 'of worth
dout,' 'often dout,' 'often doubt,' 'oft adoubt,' 'oft delase,'
'over-cloud,' 'of a pound,' and others."</p></blockquote>

<p>This, it may be added, is the sort of stuff—<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89" href="#Page_89">[89]</a></span>
<i>incredibile dictu</i>—that our children have to get by
heart; for this Press, be it remembered, practically
controls half the English Literature examinations
in England. As students know
quite well that nine examiners out of ten will
set their questions from "the Clarendon Press
notes," it is with "the Clarendon Press notes"
that they are obliged to cram themselves. But
to continue. Even a well-read man might be
excused for not knowing the exact meaning of
the following expression:—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"They clepe us drunkards, and with <i>swinish phrase</i></div>
<div class="i0"><i>Soil our addition</i>."</div></div></div>

<p>He turns to the notes, and having been briefly
informed that <i>clepe</i> means "call," and <i>addition</i>
"title," is left to flounder with what he can get
out of—"Could Shakespeare have had in his
mind any pun upon 'Sweyn,' which was a common
name of the kings of Denmark?"</p>

<p>Another leading characteristic of the <i>genus</i>
philologist, we mean the preposterous importance
attached by them to the smallest trifles, finds
ludicrous illustration in the following note:—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"My father, in his habit, as he lived!"</div></div></div>

<p>exclaims Hamlet to his mother. This is the
signal for:—</p>

<blockquote><p>"There is supposed to be a difficulty in these words, because
in the earlier scenes the Ghost is in his armour, to which the
word 'habit' is regarded as inappropriate. In the earlier
form of the play, as it appears in the quarto of 1603, the
Ghost enters 'in his nightgowne,' and as the words 'in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90" href="#Page_90">[90]</a></span>
habit as he lived' occur in the corresponding passage of that
edition, it is probable that on this occasion the Ghost appeared
in the ordinary dress of the king, although this is not indicated
in the stage directions of the other quartos or of the
folios."</p></blockquote>

<p>As a possible solution of this grave difficulty,
we would suggest that, as the Ghost was undoubtedly
in a very hot place, he might have
found his nightgown less oppressive than his
armour, and though it would certainly have been
more decorous to have exchanged his nightgown
for his uniform on revisiting the earth,
yet, as the visit was to his wife, he thought
perhaps less seriously about his apparel than our
editors have done. We have nothing to warrant
us in assuming that he was in his "ordinary
dress." The choice must lie between the nightgown
and the armour. But a truce to jesting.</p>

<p>If any one would understand the opacity and
callousness which philological study induces, we
would refer them to the note on Hamlet's last
sublime words, "The rest is silence":—</p>

<blockquote><p>"The quartos have 'Which have solicited, the rest is
silence.' The folios, 'Which have solicited. <a name="Correct4" id="Correct4">The rest is
silence.' 'O, O,</a> O, O. <i>Dyes.</i>' If Hamlet's speech is interrupted
by his death <a name="Correct5" id="Correct5">it would be more natural</a> that the words
'The rest is silence' should be spoken by Horatio."</p></blockquote>

<p>We said at the beginning of this article that
there was not a word of commentary on the
poetical merits of the play. We beg the editors'
pardon. They have in one note, and in one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91" href="#Page_91">[91]</a></span>
note only, ventured on an expression of critical
opinion. We all know the lines—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"There is a willow grows aslant a brook</div>
<div class="i0">That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream,"</div></div></div>

<p>etc., etc. We transcribe the note on this passage
that it may be a sign to all men of what Philology
is able to effect, an omen and testimony of
what must inevitably be the fate of Literature
if the direction and regulation of its study be
entrusted to philologists:—</p>

<blockquote><p>"This speech of the Queen is certainly unworthy of its
author and of the occasion. The enumeration of plants is
quite as unsuitable to so tragical a scene as the description
of Dover cliff in <i>King Lear</i> iv. 6. 11-24. Besides there was
no one by to witness the death of Ophelia, else she would
have been rescued."</p></blockquote>

<p>As this beggars commentary, transcription
shall suffice.</p>

<p>Now we would ask any sensible person
who has followed us, we do not say in our
own remarks—for they may be supposed to be
the expression of biassed opinion—but in the
specimens we have given of such an edition as
this of <i>Hamlet</i>, and of such an edition as we
have just reviewed of <i>Adonais</i>, what is likely to
be the fate of English Literature, as a subject of
teaching, so long as our Universities ignore their
responsibilities as the centres of culture by not
only countenancing, but assisting in the production
and dissemination of such publications
as these? How can we expect anything but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92" href="#Page_92">[92]</a></span>
anarchy wherever the subject is treated?—there
an extreme of flaccid dilettantism, here an extreme
of philological pedantry. Conceive the
tone and temper which, especially at the impressionable
age of the students for whom the book
is intended, the study of Shakespeare, under such
guides as the editors of this <i>Hamlet</i>, would be
likely to induce. Is it not monstrous that young
students between the ages of about fifteen and
eighteen should have such text books as these
inflicted on them?</p>

<p>The radical fault of those who regulate education
in our Universities and elsewhere, and prescribe
our schoolbooks, is their deplorable want
of judgment. They seem to be utterly incapable
of distinguishing between what is proper for
pure specialists and what is proper for ordinary
students. There is not a page in this edition
which does not proclaim aloud, that it could never
have been intended for the purposes to which it
has been applied, that it is the work of technical
scholars, concerned only in textual and philological
criticism and exegesis, and appealing
only to those who approach the study of Shakespeare
in the same spirit and from the same
point of view. Anything more sickening and
depressing, anything more calculated to make the
name of Shakespeare an abomination to the youth
of England it would be impossible for man to
devise. It is shameful to prescribe such books for
study in our Schools and Educational Institutes.</p>

<h3>I. A SHORT HISTORY OF ENGLISH LITERATURE<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></h3>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> <i>A Short History of English Literature.</i> By George
Saintsbury, Professor of Rhetoric and English Literature in
the University of Edinburgh.</p></div>


<p>This Short History is evidently designed for
the use of serious readers, for the ordinary
reader who will naturally look to it for general
instruction and guidance in the study of English
Literature, and to whom it will serve as a book
of reference; for students in schools and colleges,
to many of whom it will, in all likelihood, be
prescribed as a textbook; for teachers engaged
in lecturing and in preparing pupils for examination.
Of all these readers there will not be one
in a hundred who will not be obliged to take its
statements on trust, to assume that its facts are
correct, that its generalizations are sound, that its
criticisms and critical theories are at any rate not
absurd. It need hardly be said that, under these
circumstances, a writer who had any pretension
to conscientiousness would do his utmost to
avoid all such errors as ordinary diligence could
easily prevent, that he would guard scrupulously
against random assertions and reckless misstatements,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94" href="#Page_94">[94]</a></span>
that he would, in other words, spare no
pains to deserve the confidence placed in him by
those who are not qualified to check his statements
or question his dogmas, and who naturally
suppose that the post which he occupies is a
sufficient guarantee of the soundness and accuracy
of his work. But so far from Professor
Saintsbury having any sense of what is due to
his position and to his readers, he has imported
into his work the worst characteristics of irresponsible
journalism: generalizations, the sole
supports of which are audacious assertions, and
an indifference to exactness and accuracy, as
well with respect to important matters as in
trifles, so scandalous as to be almost incredible.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas More said of Tyndale's version of
the New Testament that to seek for errors in it
was to look for drops of water in the sea. What
was said very unfairly of Tyndale's work may be
said with literal truth of Professor Saintsbury's.
The utmost extent of the space at our disposal
will only suffice for a few illustrations. We will
select those which appear to us most typical.
In the chapter on Anglo-Saxon literature the
Professor favours us with the astounding statement,
that in Anglo-Saxon poetry "there is
practically no lyric."<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> It is scarcely necessary
to say that not only does Anglo-Saxon poetry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95" href="#Page_95">[95]</a></span>
abound in lyrics, but that it is in its lyrical note
that its chief power and charm consists. In the
threnody of the <i>Ruin</i>, and the <i>Grave</i>, in the
sentimental pathos of the <i>Seafarer</i>, of <i>Deor's
Complaint</i>, and of the remarkable fragment
describing the husband's pining for his wife, in
the fiery passion of the three great war-songs,
in the glowing subjective intensity of the <i>Judith</i>,
in the religious ecstasy of the <i>Holy Rood</i> and
of innumerable passages in the other poems attributed
to Cynewulf, and of the poem attributed
to Cædmon, deeper and more piercing lyric notes
have never been struck. Take such a passage
as the following from the <i>Satan</i>, typical, it may
be added, of scores of others:—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"O thou glory of the Lord! Guardian of Heaven's hosts,</div>
<div class="i0">O thou might of the Creator! O thou mid-circle!</div>
<div class="i0">O thou bright day of splendour! O thou jubilee of God!</div>
<div class="i0">O ye hosts of angels! O thou highest heaven!</div>
<div class="i0">O that I am shut from the everlasting jubilee,</div>
<div class="i0">That I cannot reach my hands again to Heaven,</div>
<div class="i0">... Nor hear with my ears ever again</div>
<div class="i0">The clear-ringing harmony of the heavenly trumpets."<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96" href="#Page_96">[96]</a></span></div></div>

<p>And this is a poetry which has "practically no
lyric"! On page 2 the Professor tells us that
there is no rhyme in Anglo-Saxon poetry; on
page 18 we find him giving an account of the
rhyming poem in the <i>Exeter Book</i>. Of Mr. Saintsbury's
method of dealing with particular works
and particular authors, one or two examples
must suffice. He tells us on page 125 that the
heroines in Chaucer's <i>Legend of Good Women</i>
are "the most hapless and blameless of Ovid's
Heroides." It would be interesting to know
what connexion Cleopatra, whose story comes
first, has with Ovid's Heroides, or if the term
"Heroides" be, as it appears to be, (for it is
printed in italics) the title of Ovid's Heroic
Epistles, what connexion four out of the ten
have with Ovid's work. In any case the statement
is partly erroneous and wholly misleading.
In the account given of the Scotch poets, the
Professor, speaking of Douglas' translation of
the <i>Æneid</i>, says, he "does not embroider on his
text." This is an excellent illustration of the
confidence which may be placed in Mr. Saintsbury's
assertions about works on which most
of his readers must take what he says on trust.
Douglas is continually "embroidering on his
text," indeed, he habitually does so. We open
his translation purely at random; we find him
turning <i>Æneid</i> II. 496-499:—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">

<p>We open <i>Æneid</i> IX. 2:—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"Irim de cœlo misit Saturnia Juno</div>
<div class="i0">Audacem ad Turnum. Luco tum forte parentis</div>
<div class="i0">Pilumni Turnus sacratâ valle sedebat.</div>
<div class="i0">Ad quem sic roseo Thaumantias ore locuta est."</div></div></div>

<p>We find it turned:—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i2">"Juno that lyst not blyn</div>
<div class="i0">Of hir auld malyce and iniquyte,</div>
<div class="i0">Hir madyn Iris from hevin sendys sche</div>

<div class="i0">I meyn Iris thys ilk fornamyt maide,</div>
<div class="i0">And with hir rosy lippis thus him said."</div></div></div>

<p>We turn to the end of the tenth <i>Æneid</i> and
we find him introducing six lines which have
nothing to correspond with them in the original.
And this is a translator who "does not embroider
on his text"! It is perfectly plain
that Professor Saintsbury has criticised and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98" href="#Page_98">[98]</a></span>
commented on a work which he could never
have inspected. The same ignorance is displayed
in the account of Lydgate. He is pronounced
to be a versifier rather than a poet, his
verse is described as "sprawling and staggering."
The truth is that Lydgate's style and
verse are often of exquisite beauty, that he was
a poet of fine genius, that his descriptions of
nature almost rival Chaucer's, that his powers
of pathos are of a high order, that, at his best,
he is one of the most musical of poets. We
have not space to illustrate what must be
obvious to any one who has not gone to encyclopædias
and handbooks for his knowledge of
this poet's writings, but who is acquainted with
the original. It will not be disputed that Gray
and Warton were competent judges of these
matters, and their verdict must be substituted
for what we have not space to prove and
illustrate. "I do not pretend," Gray says, "to
set Lydgate on a level with his master Chaucer,
but he certainly comes the nearest to him of
any contemporary writer that I am acquainted
with. His choice of expression and the smoothness
of his verse far surpass both Gower and
Occleve." Of one passage in Lydgate, Gray has
observed that "it has touched the very heart
strings of compassion with so masterly a hand
as to merit a place among the greatest poets."<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
Warton also notices his "perspicuous and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99" href="#Page_99">[99]</a></span>
musical numbers," and "the harmony, strength,
and dignity" of his verses.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Turn where we will we are confronted with
blunders. Take the account given of Shakespeare.
He began his metre, we are told, with
the lumbering "fourteeners." He did, so far
as is known, nothing of the kind. Again: "It
is only by guesses that anything is dated before
the <i>Comedy of Errors</i> at the extreme end of
1594." In answer to this it may be sufficient
to say that <i>Venus and Adonis</i> was published
in 1593, that the first part of <i>Henry VI.</i> was
acted on 3rd March, 1592, that <i>Titus Andronicus</i>
was acted on 25th January, 1594, and
that <i>Lucrece</i> was entered on the Stationers'
books 9th May, 1594. This is on a par with the
assertion, on page 315, that Shakespeare was traditionally
born on 24th April! On page 320 we
are told that <i>Measure for Measure</i> belongs to the
first group of Shakespeare's plays, to the series
beginning with <i>Love's Labour's Lost</i> and culminating
with the <i>Midsummer Night's Dream</i>. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100" href="#Page_100">[100]</a></span>
is only fair to say that the Professor places a
note of interrogation after it in a bracket, but
that it should have been placed there, even
tentatively, shows an ignorance of the very
rudiments of Shakespearian criticism which is
nothing short of astounding. Take, again, the
account given of Burke. Our readers will probably
think us jesting when we tell them that
Professor Saintsbury gravely informs us that
Burke supported the American Revolution. Is
the Professor unacquainted with the two finest
speeches which have ever been delivered in any
language since Cicero? Can he possibly be
ignorant that Burke, so far from supporting
that revolution, did all in his power to prevent
it? The whole account of Burke, it may be
added, teems with inaccuracies. The American
Revolution was not brought about under a
Tory administration. What brought that
revolution about was Charles Townshend's tax,
and that tax was imposed under a Whig administration,
as every well-informed Board-school lad
would know. Burke did not lose his seat at
Bristol owing to his support of Roman Catholic
claims. If Professor Saintsbury had turned to
one of the finest of Burke's minor speeches—the
speech addressed to the electors of Bristol—he
would have seen that Burke's support of the
Roman Catholic claims was only one, and that
not the most important, of the causes which cost
him his seat. Similar ignorance is displayed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101" href="#Page_101">[101]</a></span>
the remark (p. 629) that "Burke joined, and
indeed headed, the crusade against Warren
Hastings, in 1788." The prosecution of Warren
Hastings was undertaken on Burke's sole initiative,
not in 1788, but in 1785. A few lines
onwards we are told that the series of Burke's
writings on the French Revolution "began with
the <i>Reflections</i> in 1790, and was continued in the
<i>Letter to a Noble Lord</i>, <a name="Correct8" id="Correct8">1790."</a> <i>A Letter to a Noble
Lord</i> had nothing to do with the French Revolution,
except collaterally as it affected Burke's
public conduct, and appeared, not in 1790, but
in 1795.</p>

<p>It seems impossible to open this book anywhere
without alighting on some blunder, or on some
inaccuracy. Speaking (p. 277) of Willoughby's
well-known <i>Avisa</i>, the Professor observes that
nothing is known of Willoughby or of <i>Avisa</i>.
If the Professor had known anything about the
work, he would have known that <i>Avisa</i> is simply
an anagram made up of the initial letters of
<i>Amans</i>, <i>vxor</i>, <i>inviolata semper amanda</i>, and that
nothing is known of Avisa for the simple reason
that nothing is known of the site of More's Utopia.
On page 360 we are told that Phineas Fletcher's
<i>Piscatory Eclogues</i>, which are, of course, confounded
with his <i>Sicelides</i>, are a masque; on page
624, but this is perhaps a printer's error, that
Robertson wrote a history of Charles I. On
page 482, John Pomfret, the author of one of
the most popular poems of the eighteenth century,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102" href="#Page_102">[102]</a></span>
is called Thomas. On page 550, Pope's
<i>Moral Essays</i> are described as <i>An Epistle to
Lord Burlington</i>, presumably because the last
of them, the fourth, is addressed to that nobleman.
On page 587 we are told that Mickle died
in London: he died at Forest Hill, near Oxford.
On page 556 we are informed that Prior was
part author of a parody of the "Hind and
Panther," and that he was "imprisoned for
some years." The work referred to is wrongly
described, as it only contained parodies of certain
passages in Dryden's poem, and he was in confinement
less than two years. On page 358,
Brutus, the legendary founder of Britain, is
actually described as the son of Æneas. If Professor
Saintsbury were as familiar as he affects
to be with Geoffrey of Monmouth, with Layamon
and with the early metrical romances, he would
have known that Brutus is fabled to have been
the son of Sylvius, the son of Ascanius, and, consequently,
the great-grandson of Æneas. Many
of the Professor's critical remarks can only be
explained on the supposition that he assumes
that his readers will not take the trouble to
verify his references or question his dogmas.
We will give one or two instances. On page
468, speaking of seventeenth-century prose, he
says, with reference to Milton: "The close of the
<i>Apology</i> itself is a very little, though only a very
little, inferior to the <i>Hydriotaphia</i>." By the
<i>Apology</i> he can only mean the <i>Apology for Smectymnuus</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103" href="#Page_103">[103]</a></span>
for the defence of the English
people is in Latin. Now, will our readers credit
that one of the flattest, clumsiest and most
commonplace passages in Milton's prose writings,
as any one may see who turns to it, is
pronounced "only a little inferior" to one of
the most majestically eloquent passages in our
prose literature. That our readers may know
what Professor Saintsbury's notions of eloquence
are, we will transcribe the passage:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Thus ye have heard, readers, how many shifts and wiles
the prelates have invented to save their ill-got booty. And if it
be true, as in Scripture it is foretold, that pride and covetousness
are the sure marks of those false prophets which are to
come, then boldly conclude these to be as great seducers as
any of the latter times. For between this and the judgment day
do not look for any arch deceivers who, in spite of reformation,
will use more craft or less shame to defend their love of
the world and their ambition than these prelates have done.
And if ye think that soundness of reason or what force of
argument so ever shall bring them to an ingenuous silence,
ye think that which shall never be. But if ye take that
course which Erasmus was wont to say Luther took against
the pope and monks: if ye denounce war against their
riches and their bellies, ye shall soon discern that turban of
pride which they wear upon their heads to be no helmet of
salvation, but the mere metal and hornwork of papal jurisdiction;
and that they have also this gift, like a certain kind
of some that are possessed, to have their voice in their bellies,
which, being well drained and taken down, their great oracle,
which is only there, will soon be dumb, and the divine
right of episcopacy forthwith expiring will put us no more
to trouble with tedious antiquities and disputes."</p></blockquote>

<p>And this is "a very little, only a very little,
inferior," to the "Hydriotaphia"!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104" href="#Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>On page 652, Swift's style, that perfection of
simple, unadorned <i>sermo pedestris</i>—is described
as marked by "volcanic magnificence." On
page 300 Hooker is described as "having an
unnecessary fear of vivid and vernacular expression."
Vivid and vernacular expression is,
next to its stateliness, the distinguishing characteristic
of Hooker's style. It would be interesting
to know what is meant by the remark
on page 445 that Barrow's style is "less
severe than South's." Another example of the
same thing is the assertion on page 517 that
Joseph Glanville is one of "the chief exponents
of the gorgeous style in the seventeenth
century." Very 'gorgeous' the style
of the <i>Vanity of Dogmatizing</i>, of its later
edition the <i>Scepsis Scientifica</i>, of the <i>Sadducismus
Triumphatus</i>, of the <i>Lux Orientalis</i>, and of
the Essays!</p>

<p>Indeed, the Professor's critical dicta are as
amazing as his facts. We have only space for
one or two samples. Cowley's <i>Anacreontics</i> are
"not very far below Milton"(!) Dr. Donne was
"the most gifted man of letters next to Shakespeare."
Where Bacon, where Ben Jonson,
where Milton are to stand is not indicated.
Akenside's stilted and frigid <i>Odes</i> "fall not so
far short of Collins." We wonder what Mr.
Saintsbury's criterion of poetry can be. But we
forget, with that criterion he has furnished us.
On page 732, speaking of "a story about a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105" href="#Page_105">[105]</a></span>
hearer who knew no English, but knew Tennyson
to be a poet by the hearing," he adds that
"the story is probable and valuable, or rather
invaluable, for it points to the best if not the
only criterion of poetry." And this is a critic!
We would exhort the Professor to ponder well
Pope's lines:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"But most by numbers judge a poet's song,</div>
<div class="i2" style="letter-spacing:3em;">*****</div>
<div class="i0">In the bright muse, tho' thousand charms conspire,</div>
<div class="i0">Her voice is all these tuneful fools admire,</div>
<div class="i0">Who haunt Parnassus but to please their ear."</div></div></div>

<p>On page 734 we are told Browning's <i>James
Lee</i>—the Professor probably means <i>James Lee's
Wife</i>—is amongst "the greatest poems of the
century." On Wordsworth's line, judged not in
relation to its context, but as a single verse—"Our
birth is but a sleep and a forgetting"—we
have the following as commentary: "Even
Shakespeare, even Shelley have little more of the
echoing detonation, the auroral light of true
poetry"; very "echoing," very "detonating"—the
rhythm of "Our birth is but a sleep and a
forgetting." Mr. Saintsbury's notions of what
constitutes detonation and auroral light in
poetry appear to resemble his notions of what
constitutes eloquence in prose. Nothing, we may
add in passing, is more amusing in this volume
than Mr. Saintsbury's cool assumption of equality
as a critical authority with such a critic as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106" href="#Page_106">[106]</a></span>
Matthew Arnold, whom he sometimes patronises,
sometimes corrects, and sometimes assails. The
Professor does not show to advantage on these
occasions, and he leaves us with the impression
that if "Mr. Arnold's criticism is piecemeal,
arbitrary, fantastic, and insane," the criticism
which appears, where it is not mere nonsense,
to take its touchstones, its standards, and its
canons from those of the average Philistine is,
after all, a very poor substitute. But enough
of Mr. Saintsbury's "criticism," which is, almost
uniformly, as absurd in what it praises as in
what it censures.</p>

<p>The style, or, to borrow an expression from
Swift, what the poverty of our language compels
us to call the style, in which this book is
written, is on a par with its criticism. We will
give a few examples. "It is a proof of the
greatness of Dryden that he knew Milton for
a poet; it is a proof of the smallness (and
mighty as he was on some sides, on others he
was very small) of Milton that (if he really did
so) he denied poetry to Dryden."<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> "What the
<i>Voyage and Travaile</i> really is, is this—it is, so
far as we know, and even beyond our knowledge
in all probability and likelihood, the first
considerable example of prose in English dealing
neither with the beaten track of theology
and philosophy, nor with the, even in the
Middle Ages, restricted field of history and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107" href="#Page_107">[107]</a></span>
home topography, but expatiating freely on
unguarded plains and on untrodden hills, sometimes
dropping into actual prose romance and
always treating its subject as the poets had
treated theirs in <i>Brut</i> and <i>Mort d'Arthur</i>, in
<i>Troy-book</i> and <i>Alexandreid</i>, as a mere canvas
on which to embroider flowers of fancy."<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
Again, "With Anglo-Saxon history he deals
slightly, and despite his ardent English patriotism—his
book opens with a vigorous panegyric
of England, the first of a series extending to
the present day (from which an anthology <i>De
Laudibus Angliæ</i> might be made)—he deals
very harshly with Harold Godwinson."<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> "He
had a fit of stiff Odes in the Gray and Collins
manner." "<i>The Hind and Panther</i> (the greatest
poem ever written in the <a name="Correct9" id="Correct9">teeth of its subject)".
"His voluminous</a> Latin works have been
<i>tackled</i> by a special Wyclif Society." These
are a few of the gems in which every chapter
abounds.</p>

<p>Of Professor Saintsbury's indifference to exactness
and accuracy in details and facts we
need go no further for illustrations than to his
dates. Such things cannot be regarded as trifles
in a book designed to be a book of reference.
We will give a few instances. We are informed
on page 238 that Ascham's <i>Schoolmaster</i> was
published in 1568; it was published, as its title-page
shows, in 1570. Hume's <i>Dissertations</i> were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108" href="#Page_108">[108]</a></span>
first published, not in 1762, but in 1757. Bale's
flight to Germany was not in 1547, when such a
step would have been unnecessary, but in 1540.
Pecock was, we are told, translated to Chichester
in 1550, exactly ninety years after his death!
As if to perplex the readers of this book, two
series of dates are given; we have the dates in
the narrative and the dates in the index, and no
attempt is made to reconcile the discrepancies.
Accordingly we find in the narrative that
Caxton was probably born in 1415—in the index
that he was born in 1422; in the narrative that
Latimer, Fisher, Gascoign and Atterbury were
born respectively in 1489, in 1465, about 1537
and in 1672—in the index that they were born
respectively in 1485, 1459, 1525 and 1662; in
the narrative Gay was born in 1688—in the
index he was born in 1685. In the narrative
Collins dies in 1756, and Mrs. Browning is born
in 1806—in the index Collins dies in 1759, and
Mrs. Browning is born in 1809. The narrative
tells us that Aubrey was born in 1626, and John
Dyer <i>circa</i> 1688—in the index that Aubrey was
born in 1624 and Dyer <i>circa</i> 1700. In the index
Mark Pattison dies in 1884—in the narrative he
dies in 1889. In Professor Saintsbury's eyes
such indifference to accuracy may be venial: in
our opinion it is nothing less than scandalous.
It is assuredly most unfair to those who will
naturally expect to find in a book of reference
trustworthy information.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109" href="#Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>We must now conclude, though we have very
far from exhausted the list of errors and misstatements,
of absurdities in criticism and
absurdities in theory, which we have noted.
Bacon has observed that the best part of beauty
is that which a picture cannot express. It may
be said, with equal truth, of a bad book, that
what is worst in it is precisely that which it is
most difficult to submit to tangible tests. In
other words, it lies not so much in its errors
and inaccuracies, which, after all, may be mere
trifles and excrescences, but it lies in its tone
and colour, its flavour, its accent. Professor
Saintsbury appears to be constitutionally incapable
of distinguishing vulgarity and coarseness
from liveliness and vigour. So far from
having any pretension to the finer qualities of
the critic, he seems to take a boisterous pride in
exhibiting his grossness.</p>

<p>If our review of this book shall seem unduly
harsh, we are sorry, but a more exasperating
writer than Professor Saintsbury, with his indifference
to all that should be dear to a scholar,
the mingled coarseness, triviality and dogmatism
of his tone, the audacious nonsense of his generalisations,
and the offensive vulgarity of his
diction and style—a very well of English defiled—we
have never had the misfortune to meet
with. Turn where we will in this work, to the
opinions expressed in it, to the sentiments, to the
verdicts, to the style, the note is the same,—the
note of the <i>Das Gemeine</i>.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_19_19" id="Footnote_19_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19_19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> <i>A Short History of Modern English Literature.</i> By
Edmund Gosse. London, 1898.</p></div>


<p>The author of this work has plainly not
pondered the advice of Horace, "Sumite
materiam vestris, qui scribitis, æquam viribus."
His ambitious purpose is "to give the reader,
whether familiar with books or not, a feeling of
the evolution of English Literature in the primary
sense of the term," and he adds that "to do this
without relation to particular authors and particular
works seems to me impossible." This
may be conceded; for, a feeling of the evolution
of English or of any other literature, without
reference to particular authors and particular
books, would be analogous to the capacity for
feeling without anything to feel. But, unfortunately,
those of Mr. Gosse's readers who wish
to have the feeling to which he refers will
merely find the conditions without which, as he
so justly observes, the said feeling is impossible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111" href="#Page_111">[111]</a></span>
In other words, references, in the form of loose
and desultory gossip, to particular authors and
particular works chronologically arranged, are
all that represent the "evolution" of which he
is so anxious "to give a feeling."</p>

<p>Described simply, the work is an ordinary
manual of English Literature in which, with
Mr. Humphry Ward's <i>English Poets</i>, Sir Henry
Craik's <i>English Prose Writers</i>, Chambers' <i>Cyclopædia
of English Literature</i>, the <i>Dictionary of
National Biography</i>, and the like before him,
the writer tells again the not unfamiliar story
of the course of our Literature from Chaucer
to the present time. But Mr. Gosse is no
mere compiler, and brings to his task certain
qualifications of his own, a vague and inaccurate
but extensive knowledge of our seventeenth,
eighteenth and nineteenth century Belles
Lettres; and here, as a rule, he can acquit himself
creditably. Though far from a sound, he
is a sympathetic critic; he has an agreeable
but somewhat affected style, and can gossip
pleasantly and plausibly about subjects which
are within the range indicated. But at this
point, as is painfully apparent, his qualifications
for being an historian and critic of English
Literature end. The moment he steps out of
this area he is at the mercy of his handbooks;
so completely at their mercy that he does not
even know how to use them. And it is here
that Mr. Gosse becomes so irritating, partly because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112" href="#Page_112">[112]</a></span>
of the sheer audacity with which mere
inferences are substituted for facts and simple
assumptions for deduced generalizations, and
partly because of the habitual employment of
phraseology so vague and indeterminate that
it is difficult to submit what it conveys to positive
test. These are serious charges to bring
against any writer; and if they cannot be abundantly
substantiated, a still more serious charge
may justly be urged against the accuser.</p>

<p>To turn to the work. On page 85 Mr. Gosse
favours us with the following account of the
<i>Faerie Queene</i>: "A certain grandeur which sustains
the three great Cantos of Truth, Temperance,
and Chastity fades away as we proceed....
The structure of it is loose and incoherent
when we compare it with the epic grandeur
of the masterpieces of Ariosto and Tasso." It
would be difficult to match this; every word
which is not a blunder is an absurdity. Where
are "the three great Cantos"? Can Mr. Gosse
possibly be ignorant that the poem is divided
into books, each book containing twelve Cantos?
Assuming, however, that he has confounded
books with Cantos, where is the great book
dealing with 'Truth'? As he places it before
'Temperance,' we presume that he means the
first book and that he has confounded 'Truth'
with 'Holiness.' This is pretty well, to begin
with. Where, we next ask in amazement,
is the 'grandeur' which sustains the prolix
farrago of the third book, and which 'fades<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113" href="#Page_113">[113]</a></span>
away' as we proceed to the only book which
almost rivals the first and second, the fifth,
and the sublimest portion of the whole work,
the superb Cantos which represent all that
remains of the seventh? What, we gasp, is
the meaning of the 'epic grandeur' of Ariosto?
and "the loose and incoherent structure" of the
<i>Faerie Queene</i> when compared with that of the
<i>Orlando Furioso</i>? Could any poem be more
loose and incoherent in structure than the
<i>Orlando</i>, or any term be less appropriate to
its tone and style than 'grandeur'? On page
80 he actually tells us that Fox's well-known
<i>Book of Martyrs</i> was written in Latin and translated
by John Day, and that it is John Day's
translation of the Latin original which represents
that work, confounding Fox's <i>Commentarii
Rerum in Ecclesiâ gestarum</i>, etc., printed
at Basil with the <i>Acts and Monuments of the
Church</i>, and making John Day, the publisher of
it, the translator of it into English! And this is
his account of one of the most celebrated works
in our language. Of Swift's <i>Sentiments of a
Church of England Man</i>, we have the following
account: "That such a tract as the <i>Sentiments
of a Church of England Man</i>, with its gusts of
irony, its white heat of preposterous moderation,
led on towards Junius is obvious." This is an
excellent example of the confidence which may
be placed in Mr. Gosse's assertions. Of this
pamphlet, it may be sufficient to say that there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114" href="#Page_114">[114]</a></span>
is not a single touch of irony or satire in it; that
it stands almost alone among Swift's tracts for
its perfectly temperate and logical tone; it is a
calm appeal to pure reason. There is the same
audacity of assertion in classing Feltham's
<i>Resolves</i> with Hall's and Overbury's Character
Sketches, and Earle's <i>Microcosmogonie</i> as "a
typical example" of "a curious school of comic
or ironic portraiture, partly ethical and partly
dramatic." In 1625, we are told that Bacon
completed the <i>Sylva Sylvarum</i>. If Mr. Gosse
knew anything of Bacon's philosophical writings,
he would have known that the <i>Sylva Sylvarum</i>
never was and never could have been completed,
for it was in itself a fragment—a mere collection
of materials to be incorporated in the <i>Phœnomena
Universi</i>, a work which was to have been six
times larger than Pliny's <i>Natural History</i>. In
giving an account of Tillotson, he speaks of
"the serene and insinuating periods" of the elegant
latitudinarian who "was assiduous in saying
what he had to say in the most graceful and
intelligible manner possible." A more perfect
description of the very opposite of Tillotson's
style could hardly be given. Those who are
acquainted with Fuller's writings will be equally
surprised to find him classed with Jeremy
Taylor and Henry More, and to learn that his
style is 'florid and involved,' distinguished by
its 'long-windedness' and 'exuberance.' Has Mr.
Gosse no apprehension of his readers turning to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115" href="#Page_115">[115]</a></span>
the originals and testing his statements? We
have another of these bold assertions in the
account of Lydgate, derived, we suspect, from
a hasty generalization from a remark made
about him in Mr. Ward's <i>British Poets</i>. "Lydgate,"
says Mr. Gosse, "had a most defective
ear; his verses are not to be scanned. His
ear was bad and tuneless." Any one who has
read Lydgate knows that, if we except his
heroic couplets, a more musical poet is not to
be found in the fifteenth century, or, indeed,
in our language; the softness and smoothness
of his verse, wherever he writes in stanzas,
as he generally does, is indeed his chief characteristic.
These remarks are minor illustrations
of an accomplishment in which Mr. Gosse
has no rival.</p>

<p>The Euphuists of the sixteenth century drew,
for purposes of simile and illustration, on a
fabulous natural history which assumed the existence
of certain animals, herbs, and minerals,
and of certain properties and qualities possessed
by them. This gave great point and picturesqueness
to their style, and though it was certainly
misleading and occasionally perplexing
to those who went to them for natural history,
it had a most charming and imposing effect.
Mr. Gosse seems to have imported a similar
fiction into criticism. Of this we have a most
amusing illustration on page 155. Speaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116" href="#Page_116">[116]</a></span>
of Herrick Mr. Gosse remarks, "In the midst
of these extravagances, like Meleager winding
his <i>pure white violets</i>"—the Italics are ours—"into
the <i>gaudy garland of late Greek Euphuism</i>,
we find Robert Herrick." Meleager's
Anthology is not extant, but the dedication
is, and from that dedication we know exactly
from what poets it was compiled. It ranged
from about <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 700 till towards the close of
the Alexandrian Age, for, with the exception
of Antipater of Sidon, it is very doubtful
whether he inserted any epigrams by his contemporaries,
but he admitted a hundred and
thirty-one of his own. In other words his
collection comprised epigrams composed by the
masters preceding the Alexandrian Age from
Archilochus downwards, and by those who,
during that age and afterwards, cultivated
with scrupulous care the simplicity and purity
of the early models. Indeed, the poets represented
in his Anthology are, with one exception,
the artists of Greek epigram in its
purest, simplest, and chastest form. That one
exception is himself. In him are first apparent
the <i>dulcia vitia</i> of the Decadence; he
is full of dainty subtleties, he is almost more
Oriental than Greek, his style is luscious, elaborate
and florid. Such, then, was the composition
of "the gaudy garland of late Greek
Euphuism," and such the nature of the "pure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117" href="#Page_117">[117]</a></span>
white violets" wound into it by Meleager. It
is amusing to trace Mr. Gosse's rodomontade
to its source. In the well-known dedication
to which we have referred, Meleager prettily
compares the various poets, from whose works
he selects, to flowers, speaking modestly of
his own contributions as "early white violets."
To critics like Mr. Gosse the rest is easy.
Meleager, he no doubt argued, was an excellent
poet; he belonged to a late age: 'Euphuism'—a
delightfully vague term, is likely
to characterise a late age; a poet who compares
his verses to white violets had evidently
a taste for simplicity, and presumably, therefore,
was no Euphuist; a gaudy garland is an
excellent set off for pure white violets. And
so, to the great perplexity of scholars, but to
the great satisfaction of those who enjoy a
pretty sentence, Meleager will continue "to
wind his pure white violets into the gaudy
garland of late Greek Euphuism."</p>

<p>We have a similar illustration of the same
thing in Mr. Gosse's account of Shaftesbury.
We are told that he "was perhaps the greatest
literary force between Dryden and Swift";
that "he deserves remembrance as the first
who really broke down the barrier which excluded
England from taking her proper place
in the civilization of literary Europe"; that "he
set an example for the kind of prose which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118" href="#Page_118">[118]</a></span>
to mark the central years of the century";
that "his style glitters and rings, and ...
yet so curious that one marvels that it should
have fallen completely into neglect"; that
"he was the first Englishman who developed
theories of formal virtue, who attempted to
harmonize the beautiful with the true and
the good"; that the modern attitude of mind
seems to meet us first in the graceful cosmopolitan
writings of Shaftesbury; that "without
a Shaftesbury there would hardly have been a
Ruskin or a Pater." Such amazing nonsense
almost confounds refutation by its sheer absurdity.</p>

<p>With regard to the first statement, it may
be sufficient to say that between the period
of Dryden's literary activity and the publication
of Swift's <i>Battle of the Books</i> and <i>Tale
of a Tub</i> were flourishing Hobbes, Izaak Walton,
Bunyan, Temple, and Locke; that between
the publication of the <i>Tale of a Tub</i> and of
Shaftesbury's collected writings were flourishing
Addison, Steele, De Foe, Arbuthnot, Berkeley.
With regard to the second statement, it would
be interesting to know how a writer who had
been preceded by Bacon, Hobbes and Locke,
could be described as a writer who had been the
first "to break down the barrier which excluded
England from taking her proper place in the
civilization of literary Europe." The truth is,
that Shaftesbury exercised no influence at all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119" href="#Page_119">[119]</a></span>
on Continental Literature until long after our
Literature had generally become influential in
France. Equally absurd and baseless is the
remark that he "set an example of the kind
of prose that was to mark the central years
of the century." Whose prose was affected by
him? Bolingbroke's? or Fielding's? or Richardson's?
or Middleton's? or Johnson's? or Goldsmith's?
or Hume's? or Hawkesworth's? or
Sterne's? or Smollett's? or Chesterfield's? that of
the writers in the <i>Monthly Review</i>? or in the
<i>Adventurer</i>? or in the <i>World</i>? or in the <i>Connoisseur</i>?
To say of Shaftesbury's style that "it glitters
and rings," is to say what betrays utter
ignorance of its characteristics. As a rule, it is
diffuse, involved, and cumbrous, affected, but with
an affectation which sedulously aims at the very
opposite effects of "glittering and ringing."
When he is eloquent, as in the <i>Moralists</i>, he imitates
the style of Plato; his vice is florid verbosity;
it may be doubted whether a single sentence
could be found to which Mr. Gosse's description
would be applicable. If, it may be added, his style
had "fallen completely into neglect," it is somewhat
surprising that "he should set an example
for the kind of prose which was to mark the central
years of the century." When we are told
that he was "the first Englishman who attempted
to harmonize the beautiful with the true and the
good," we ask in amazement whether Mr. Gosse
has ever inspected the <i>Hymns</i> of Spenser and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120" href="#Page_120">[120]</a></span>
the writings of the Cambridge Platonists; and
when he tells us that without a Shaftesbury
there would hardly have been a Ruskin or a
Pater, we would suggest to him that both
Ruskin and Pater were perhaps not ignorant of
the Platonic Dialogues. In the account given
of Spenser, a poem is attributed to him which
he never wrote. "In one of his early pieces,
<i>The Oak and The Briar</i>, went far," etc., the oak
and the briar is simply an episode in the second
eclogue of the <i>Shepherd's Calendar</i>. Mr. Gosse,
probably finding it quoted in some book of selections,
has jumped to the conclusion that it is a
separate poem. Of Mr. Gosse's qualifications for
dealing with Spenser, we have, by the way, an
excellent example in the following remark:
"Spenser, although he boasted of his classical
acquirements, was singularly little affected by
Greek or even Latin ideas." Spenser's <i>Hymns</i> in
honour of Love and in Honour of Beauty are
simply saturated with Platonism, being indeed
directly derived from the <i>Phædrus</i> and the
<i>Symposium</i>, numberless passages from which
are interwoven with the poems. The whole
scheme of the <i>Faerie Queene</i> was suggested by,
and based on, Aristotle's <i>Ethics</i> with elaborate
particularity, Arthur, in his relation to the
several knights, corresponding to the virtue
<ins title="megalopsychia">μεγαλοψυχια</ins> in its relation to the other virtues.
The conclusion of the tenth canto of the first
book is simply an allegorical presentation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121" href="#Page_121">[121]</a></span>
relation of the <ins title="bios theôrêtikos">βιος θεωρητικος</ins> to practical life.
The "Castle of Medina" in the second book is a
minutely technical exposition of the Aristotelian
doctrine of the mean, modified by the Platonic
theory of morals: the three mothers being the
<ins title="logistikê">λογιστικη</ins>, the <ins title="epithymêtikê">επιθυμητικη</ins>, and <ins title="thymêtikê">θυμητικη</ins>, the three
daughters, Elissa, Perissa, and Medina, being
respectively the Aristotelian <ins title="elleipsis">ελλειψις</ins>, the
<ins title="hyperbolê">ὑπερβολη</ins> and the <ins title="mesotês">μεσοτης</ins>. In fact, the whole
passage is simply an allegory of the Aristotelian
doctrine of the mean. The whole of the ninth
canto of the second book is founded on the famous
passage in the <i>Timæus</i> describing the anatomy of
man. In truth the poem teems with references
to Plato and Aristotle, and with passages imitated
from the Greek poets, as every scholar knows.
And this is a poet "singularly little affected by
Greek ideas!"</p>

<p>The same astonishing ignorance is displayed
in a remark about Milton. We are told that
in his youth he was "slightly subjected to influence
from Spenser." If Mr. Gosse had any
adequate acquaintance with Milton and Spenser,
he would have known that Spenser was to
Milton almost what Homer was to Virgil, that
Spenser's influence simply pervades his poems,
not his youthful poems only, but <i>Paradise
Lost</i> and even <i>Paradise Regained</i>. On page 194
we find this sentence: "From 1660 onwards
... what France originally, and then England,
chose was the <i>imitatio veterum</i>, the Literature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122" href="#Page_122">[122]</a></span>
in prose and verse which seemed most closely
to copy the models of Latin style. Aristotle
and Horace were taken, not merely as patterns,
but as arbiters." It would be very interesting to
know what English author took Aristotle as a
pattern for style. Is Mr. Gosse acquainted with
the characteristics of Aristotle's style? Should
he ever become so, he will probably have some
sense of the immeasurable absurdity of asserting
that our prose writers from 1660 onwards took
that style for their model. On a par with this is
the assertion that up to 1605 Bacon had mainly
issued his works in "Ciceronian Latin." Is
Mr. Gosse aware of the meaning of "Ciceronian
Latin"? Very "Ciceronian" indeed is Bacon's
Latinity, and particularly that of the <i>Meditationes
Sacræ</i>, the only work published in Latin
by Bacon up to 1605! It is scarcely necessary
to say, in passing, that such works as Bacon
had published up to 1605 were, with the one
exception referred to, all in English. Nothing,
it may be added, is so annoying in this
book as its slushy dilettantism. Mr. Gosse
appears to be incapable of accuracy and precision.
Thus he tells us that Chaucer's expedition
to Italy in 1372 was "the first of several
Italian expeditions." Chaucer, so far as is
known, visited Italy, after this, exactly once.
Again, he tells us that the <i>Complaint of Mars</i>
and the <i>Parliament of Fowls</i> are interesting as
showing that Chaucer had completely abandoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123" href="#Page_123">[123]</a></span>
his imitation of French models. Chaucer wrote
several poems in the pure French style, and
based on French models, after the date of these
poems. Such would be the Rondel <i>Merciless
Beauty</i> suggested by Williamme d'Amiens, the
<i>Compleynt of Venus</i>, partly adapted and partly
translated from three Ballades by Sir Otes de
Graunson, and the <i>Compleynt to his Empty
Purse</i>, modelled on a Ballade by Eustache Deschamps,
while French influence continued to
modify his work throughout. On page 238 we
are told that Thomson revived the Spenserian
stanza; it had been revived by Pope, Prior,
Shenstone, and Akenside. On page 151 we
are informed that the first instalment of Clarendon's
History remained unprinted till 1752,
and the rest of it till 1759. If Mr. Gosse knew
anything about one of the most remarkable
controversies of the eighteenth century, he
would have known that the greater part of
it was printed and published between 1702 and
1704, and frequently reprinted between 1704
and 1731.</p>

<p>There is not a chapter in the book which
does not teem with errors. Trissino's <i>Sofonisba</i>
was not the only work in which blank verse
had attained any prominence in Italy about
1515; it had been employed in works equally
prominent, by Rucellai in his <i>Rosmunda</i>, and
in his <i>Oreste</i>, as well as in his didactic poem
<i>L'Api</i>, and by Alamanni in his <i>Antigone</i>, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124" href="#Page_124">[124]</a></span>
of which were composed within a few years
of that date. On page 120 we are told that
Davies was the first to employ, on a long flight,
the heroic quatrain; it had been employed by
Spenser in a poem extending to nearly a
thousand lines. Nor was Surrey's essay in
<i>terza rima</i> "the earliest in the language."
Chaucer made the same experiment, though a
little irregularly, in the <i>Compleynt to his Lady</i>.
We are told on page 79 that Gascoigne was
"the first translator of Greek tragedy." Gascoigne
never translated a line from the Greek.
His <i>Jocasta</i>, to which presumably the reference
is made, is simply an adaptation of Ludovico
Dolce's <i>Giocasta</i>. On page 25 we are informed
that "Gower's French verse has mainly disappeared."
Gower is not known to have written
anything in French except the <i>Ballades</i>
and the <i>Speculum Meditantis</i>, both of which
are extant, as it is inexcusable in any historian
of English Literature not to know.
The account given on page 25 of the <i>Confessio
Amantis</i> shows that Mr. Gosse is very imperfectly
acquainted with what he so fluently
criticises, or he would have been aware that
the seventh book is purely episodical and has
nothing whatever to do with "The lover's
symptoms and experience." In the account
of Pope we are informed that "Boileau discouraged
love poetry and Pope did not seriously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125" href="#Page_125">[125]</a></span>
attempt it." Pope is the author of the most
famous love poem in the eighteenth century,
<i>Eloisa to Abelard</i>, to say nothing of the <i>Elegy
to an Unfortunate Lady</i>, of the beautiful
hymn to Love in the second chorus in the
tragedy of <i>Brutus</i>, and the exquisite fragment
supposed to have been addressed to Lady Mary
Wortley Montagu. "The satires of Pope," he
continues, "would not have been written but for
those of his French predecessor." Can Mr. Gosse
possibly be ignorant that the satires of Pope
are modelled on the Satires and Epistles of
Horace, that they owe absolutely nothing to
Boileau, not even the hint for applying Roman
satire to modern times, as he had precedents
in his own countrymen Dryden and Rochester?</p>

<p>Mr. Gosse's criticism is often very amusing,
as here, speaking of Gibbon: "Perhaps he
leaned on the strength of his style too much,
and <i>sacrificed the abstract to the concrete</i>." Of all
historians who have ever lived, Gibbon is the
most "abstract" and has most sacrificed the
"concrete" to the "abstract," as every student
of history knows. On a par with this is the
prodigious statement (p. 291) that there is "an
absence of emotional imagination" in Burke!
That excellent man, Mr. Pecksniff, was, we are
told, in the habit of using any word that
occurred to him as having a fine sound and
rounding a sentence well, without much care
for its meaning; "and this," says his biographer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126" href="#Page_126">[126]</a></span>
"he did so boldly and in such an imposing
manner that he would sometimes stagger the
wisest people and make them gasp again."
This is precisely Mr. Gosse's method. About
the propriety of his epithets and statements, so
long as they sound well, he never troubles himself;
sometimes they are so vague as to mean
anything, as often they have no meaning at all,
as here: "His [that is Shelley's] style, carefully
considered, is seen to rest on a basis built about
1760, from which it is every moment springing
and sparkling, like a fountain, in columns of
ebullient lyricism." Could pure nonsense go
further? We have another illustration of the
same audacity of absurd assertion on page 260.
We are there informed—Mr. Gosse is speaking
of our prose literature about the centre of the
eighteenth century—that "Philosophy by this
time had become detached from <i>belles lettres</i>;
it was now quite indifferent to those who practised
it, whether their sentences were harmonious
or no.... Philosophy in fact quitted literature."
If there was any period in our prose
literature when philosophy was in the closest
alliance with belles lettres, and was most
studious of the graces of style, it was between
about 1750 and 1771. In those years appeared
Hutcheson's <i>System of Moral Philosophy</i>, Adam
Smith's <i>Theory of Moral Sentiments</i>, one of
the most eloquent philosophical treatises ever
written, Burke's <i>Treatise on the Sublime and
Beautiful</i>, Reid's <i>Inquiry into the Human Mind</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127" href="#Page_127">[127]</a></span>
Tucker's <i>Light of Nature Pursued</i>, Beattie's
<i>Essay on Truth</i>, to say nothing of Hume's
<i>Inquiry concerning the Principles of Morals</i>,
his <i>Political Discourses</i>, and his <i>Natural History
of Religion</i>, all of them works pre-eminently
distinguished by the graces of style, while so
far from philosophy quitting belles lettres, it
was during these years that the foundations of
philosophical criticism were laid by Burke,
Harris, Hurd, Kames, and others. Mr. Gosse
appears to have forgotten that he had himself
told us (p. 205) that Shaftesbury's style set the
example of the prose which was to mark the
central years of the century! Thus again Burton's
<i>Anatomy of Melancholy</i> is "an entertaining
neurotic compendium"; Bacon's <i>Essays</i> are
"often mere notations ... enlarged in
many cases merely to receive the impressions
of a Machiavellian ingenuity." Shelley's <i>Triumph
of Life</i> is "a noble but vague gnomic poem, in
which Petrarch's Trionfi are summed up and
sometimes excelled." Keats' "great odes are
Titanic and Titianic." On page 284 we are informed
that for fifteen years after the close of
1800 "poetry may be said to have been stationary
in England." When we remember that within
these years appeared the best of Wordsworth's
poems, the best of Coleridge's, the best of Scott's,
the best of Crabbe's, the first two cantos of
<i>Childe Harold</i>, the best of Campbell's, the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128" href="#Page_128">[128]</a></span>
of Moore's, and of Southey's—we wonder what
can be meant, till we read on to find that it was
"on the contrary extremely active." But "its
activity took the form of the gradual acceptance
of the new romantic ideas, the slow expulsion
of the old classic taste, and the multiplication
of examples of what had once for all been
supremely accomplished in the hollows of the
Quantocks." In other words, its activity took the
form of its activity, and its activity led to its
becoming stationary. Mr. Gosse is sometimes
solemnly oracular, as here: "It is a sentimental
error to suppose that the winds of God blow
only through the green tree; it is sometimes
the dry tree which is peculiarly favourable to
their passage." It is not sometimes, we submit,
but always that the dry tree will be most propitious
to their passage. But we like Mr. Gosse
best when he is eloquent, as here: "In the
chapel of Milton's brain, entirely devoted though
it was to a Biblical form of worship, there were
flutes and trumpets to accompany one vast
commanding organ." No wonder poor Milton
suffered, as we know he did suffer, from
insomnia!</p>

<p>The statement that "so miserable is the
poverty of the first half of the seventeenth
century, when we have mentioned Pecock and
Capgrave, there is no other prose writer to be
named," is bad enough. But to sum up Pecock's
work with the remark, "the matter is paradoxical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129" href="#Page_129">[129]</a></span>
and casuistical reasoning on controversial
points, in which he secures the sympathy neither
of the new thought nor the old," is to demonstrate
that Mr. Gosse knows nothing whatever
about it. The <i>Repressor</i> is in many important
respects one of the most remarkable works in our
early prose Literature. It would be interesting
to know what is the meaning of the following:
"The masterpiece of Chillingworth stands almost
alone in a sort of underwood of Theophrastian
character sketches." Does Mr. Gosse suppose
that English prose Literature in and about 1637
is represented by Hall's <i>Characters of Vices and
Virtues</i>, by Sir Thomas Overbury's <i>Characters</i>,
and by Earle's <i>Microcosmographie</i>, which appeared
respectively, not in and about 1637, but
in 1608, in 1614, and in 1628? If this was the
underwood in which Chillingworth's work stood,
it stood also in a dense forest represented by
some of the most celebrated prose writings of
the seventeenth century, such as the greater
part of the writings of Bacon and of Raleigh,
the <i>Anatomy of Melancholy</i>, Selden's <i>Titles of
Honour</i> and <i>Mare Clausum</i>, Lord Herbert of
Cherbury's <i>De Veritate</i>, Feltham's <i>Resolves</i>, the
best of Hall's writings, Purchas' <i>Pilgrims</i>, Barclay's
<i>Argenis</i>, the Histories of Speed, Stowe,
Hayward, and Raleigh, Heylin's <i>Microcosmus</i>,
Prynne's <i>Histrio-Mastix</i>, and the famous sermons
of Lancelot Andrewes, all of which appeared
between 1608 and 1637. These are the sort of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130" href="#Page_130">[130]</a></span>
remarks in which Mr. Gosse habitually indulges.
We have another example in the following:
"Shelley's attitude to style is in the main retrograde,"
a generalization based on the fact
that he was no admirer of "the arabesque of
the cockney school." But were Shelley's chief
contemporaries admirers of the arabesque of
the cockney school, or were they affected by it?
Was Wordsworth, was Coleridge, or Southey,
or Byron, or Crabbe, or Campbell, or Landor?—a
question which Mr. Gosse probably never
stopped to ask himself. On a par with this is
the absurd assertion that "English poetry was
born again during the autumn months of 1797."
The appearance of the <i>Lyrical Ballads</i> did not
make, but mark, an era in our poetry. The
revolution of which they were the expression
had been maturing, as surely but distinctly as
the social and political revolution marked by
the assembly of the States-General ten years
before. There was hardly a note struck in the
<i>Lyrical Ballads</i> which had not been struck in
our poetry between 1740 and the date of their
appearance.</p>

<p>To call this compilation a <i>History of Modern
English Literature</i> is ludicrous. Mr. Gosse has
no conception even of the eras into which our
Literature naturally falls, or of the movements
which in each of those eras defined themselves.
Nothing could be more misleading and inadequate
than the accounts given of the historians, theologians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131" href="#Page_131">[131]</a></span>
philosophers, and critics, many of whom—nay,
whole schools of whom—are not noticed
at all. Sidney's epoch-marking little treatise is
dismissed in four unmeaning lines as "an urbane
and eloquent essay, which labours under but one
disadvantage, namely, that when it was composed
in 1581 there was scarcely any poesy in
England to be defended. This was posthumously
printed in 1595." Ben Jonson's not less
remarkable <i>Discoveries</i> are not even mentioned.
How writers like Bacon, Hooker, Hobbes, Locke,
and Berkeley fare we have not space to illustrate.
Mr. Gosse, indeed, judging by his excursions
into the realms of theology and philosophy,
has certainly been wise to assign more
space to <i>The Flower and the Leaf</i> than is assigned
to Hobbes, Barrow, Butler, and Paley put
together. We have by no means exhausted the
list of blunders and absurdities to be found in
this book; but we have, we fear, exhausted the
patience of our readers, and we must bring our
examination of it to a close.</p>

<p>The melancholy thing about all this is the
perfect impunity with which such works as
these can be given to the public. We have
not the smallest doubt that this book has been
extolled to the skies in reviews which have not
detected a single error in it, and which have
accepted its generalizations and its criticisms
with unquestioning credulity; and we have as
little doubt that those scholars who have discerned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132" href="#Page_132">[132]</a></span>
its defects and absurdities have chosen,
from motives possibly of kindness, possibly of
prudence, and possibly in mere contempt, to
maintain silence about them. Had it appeared
twenty years ago, it would instantly have been
exposed and exploded, indeed no writer would
have dared to insult serious readers by such a
publication. What every reader has a right to
demand from those who take upon themselves
to instruct him are sincerity, industry, and competence;
and what no critic has a right to condone
is ostentatious indifference on the part of
an author to the responsibilities incurred by him
in undertaking to teach the public.</p>

<p>The sooner Mr. Gosse, and writers like Mr.
Gosse, come to understand that, however ingeniously
expressed, reckless generalizations,
random assertions and the specious semblance
of knowledge, erudition, and authority may
pass current for a time, but are certain at last
to be detected and exposed, the better for themselves
and the better for their readers. If, too,
they wish justice to be done to the accomplishments
which they really possess, they will do
well to remember what is implied in the proverb
<i>Ne sutor ultra crepidam</i>, and what the Germans
mean by <span class="smcap">Vermessenheit</span>.</p>

<h2><a name="LOG-ROLLING_AND_EDUCATION" id="LOG-ROLLING_AND_EDUCATION"></a>LOG-ROLLING AND EDUCATION</h2>


<p>We see no objection to Mutual Admiration
Societies; they are institutions which
afford much pleasure, and can, as a rule, do
little harm. If vanity be a foible, it is a foible
well worth cherishing, and will be treated
tenderly even by a philosopher. For, of all the
illusions which give a zest to life, the illusions
created by this flattering passion are the most
delightful and inspiring. They are so easily
evoked; they respond with such impartial obsequiousness
to the call of the humblest magician.
He has but to speak the word—and they
are made; to command—and they are created.
A becomes what B and C pronounce him to
be, and what A and C have done for B, that
will B and A do in turn for C. It is a delicious
occupation, no doubt, a feast for each, in
which no crude surfeit reigns, where, in Bacon's
phrase, satisfaction and appetite are perpetually
interchangeable; it is like the herbage in the
Paradise of the Spanish poet, "quanto mas se<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134" href="#Page_134">[134]</a></span>
goza mas renace,"—the more we enjoy it the
more it grows. It is an old game—"Vetus
fabula per novos histriones":—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"'Twas, 'Sir, your law,' and 'Sir, your eloquence,'</div>
<div class="i0">'Yours Cowper's manner and yours Talbot's sense';</div>
<div class="i0">Thus we dispose of all poetic merit:</div>
<div class="i0">Yours Milton's genius and mine Homer's spirit.</div>
<div class="i0">Walk with respect behind, while we at ease</div>
<div class="i0">Weave laurel crowns and take what name we please.</div>
<div class="i0">'My dear Tibullus!' if that will not do,</div>
<div class="i0">Let me be Horace, and be Ovid you."</div></div></div>

<p>And there is this advantage. If a sufficient
number of magicians can, or will, combine, these
illusions may not only serve each magician for
life, but become, for a time, simply indistinguishable
from realities. Now, as we said before, we
see no great harm in this. It is, to say the least,
a very amiable and brotherly employment; and
were it quite disinterested and honest, it would
be closely allied with that virtue which St. Paul
exalts above all virtues. But everything has or
ought to have its limits. When Boswell attempted
to defend certain Methodists who had
been expelled from the University of Oxford,
Johnson retorted that the University was perfectly
right—"They were examined, and found
to be mighty ignorant fellows." "But," said
Boswell, "was it not hard to expel them? for I
am told they were good beings." "I believe,"
replied the sage, "that they might be good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135" href="#Page_135">[135]</a></span>
beings, but they were not fit to be in the
University of Oxford. A cow is a very good
animal in the field, but we turn her out of a
garden."</p>

<p>To our certain knowledge many of those who
owe their reputation to the art to which we
are referring are good beings, and we have
little doubt that most of those who are least
scrupulous in practising it are good beings also.
Indeed it may be conceded at once that there
is always a strong presumption that members
of Mutual Admiration Societies belong to this
class. On the reciprocity of essentially Christian
virtues their very existence depends. Whatever
may be thought of their heads, their hearts are
pretty sure to be in the right place. They may,
it is true, act more in the spirit of the precept
that we should do unto others as we would
they should do unto us than in that of the precept
which pronounces that it is more blessed
to give than to receive. This, however, is a trifle—one
of those distinctions without differences
which are so common in Christian ethics. But
for ourselves we must, as we have said before,
discriminate. To the cow in the field we have
no objection; it is of the cow in the garden that
we complain.</p>

<p>To drop metaphor: there are certain spheres
of literary activity in which the circulation of
mutual puffery by this clique or by that clique<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136" href="#Page_136">[136]</a></span>
can do comparatively little harm to any one or
to anything. There are some subjects on which
every reader is not only perfectly competent to
form his own judgment, but is pretty certain to
do so. He may amuse himself by seeing what
the critics have to say, and he may be induced
by them in the first instance to turn to the book
which is in question, but he is practically unaffected
by any opinions unless they happen to
coincide with his own. Such is the case with
books of travel, with novels, and, as a rule, with
poetry. Here the arts of the log-roller are as
harmless as the frolics of whales with tubs. No
one takes what he sees seriously except those
who are engaged in the pastime. If Mr. A cannot
give the general public what it appreciates,
nothing that Mr. B can say will cajole that
public into believing that it has what it has not.
Mr. C and Mr. D may vociferate, till they are
hoarse, that "Mr. E is the subtlest and most
discriminating critic that the English-speaking
world has ever known"; but if Mr. E's eulogies
of Mr. C's verses and of Mr. D's novels are not
corroborated by the general reader's independent
judgment, the fame of Messrs. C and D will
not extend beyond their clique. If in poetry or
prose fiction trash succeeds, as it undoubtedly
does, it succeeds not because of the skill with
which it has been puffed, though this may be a
factor in its success, but because it hits the popular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137" href="#Page_137">[137]</a></span>
taste. The public is seldom deceived except
when it wishes to be deceived. Log-rolling has
much to answer for: it loads our bookstalls
with nonsense and rubbish, it impedes the production
of sound literature, it degrades the
standard of taste, it degrades the standard of
aim and attainment, and indirectly it is in every
way mischievous to literature. But we very
much question whether in the case of publications
which appeal directly to general readers,
and are within the scope of their judgments,
the fortune of a book is in any way affected
by the arts of the log-roller. Amusement
mingled with impatience is probably the prevailing
sentiment when Mr. C and Mr. D are
loud in each other's praises. We remember the
amœbæan strains of Hayley and Miss Seward
in Porson's epigram:—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0"><i>Miss Seward</i>: Tuneful poet, Britain's glory;</div>
<div class="i6">Mr. Hayley, that is you.</div>
<br />
<div class="i0"><i>Mr. Hayley</i>:&nbsp; Ma'am, you carry all before you;</div>
<div class="i6">Trust me, Lichfield Swan, you do.</div>
<br />
<br />
<div class="i0"><i>Miss Seward</i>: Ode, didactic, epic, sonnet;</div>
<div class="i6">Mr. Hayley, you're divine.</div>
<br />
<div class="i0"><i>Mr. Hayley</i>:&nbsp; Ma'am, I'll take my oath upon it,</div>
<div class="i6">You yourself are all the nine.</div></div></div>

<p>Or, in a less good-natured mood, we may perhaps
recall with a certain satisfaction Pope's
cruel but pathetic picture of the minor log-rollers
of his day:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138" href="#Page_138">[138]</a></span>—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">Next plunged a feeble but a desperate pack,</div>
<div class="i0">With each a sickly brother at his back.</div>
<div class="i0">Sons of a day! just buoyant on the flood,</div>
<div class="i0">Then numbered with the puppies in the mud.</div></div></div>

<p>But there are certain subjects and certain
spheres in which the arts of the log-roller, if
equally contemptible, are not quite so harmless.</p>

<p>During the last fifteen years the Press has
been teeming with books designed to circulate
among readers who are seriously interested in
<i>belles lettres</i> and criticism. Some of them have
appeared as volumes in a series, some as independent
monographs and manuals, and some in
the humbler forms of editorial introductions
and notes. Among them may be found works
of really distinguished scholars, and works in
every way worthy of such scholars; and it is no
doubt works like these which have given credit
and authority generally to publications of this
kind. The popularity of these productions has
been extraordinary, and their manufacture has
become one of the most lucrative of hackney
employments. Nor is this all. Their professed
purpose is the dissemination of serious instruction,
is to become text-books in literary history
and in literary criticism; and, as text-books on
those subjects, they have made their way, or
are making their way, not merely into our public
libraries, but also into the libraries of nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139" href="#Page_139">[139]</a></span>
every educational institute in England. Indeed
it would not be too much to say that if, among
general readers, about eighty in every hundred
derive almost all they know about English
literature, both historically and critically, from
these volumes, in our schools and colleges,
the average number of those whose studies
are and ought to be independent of them is
yearly diminishing. It is of these text-books
and of the responsibilities incurred by those
who produce and circulate them that we wish
to speak.</p>

<p>We have already commented on the distinction
which must be drawn between what is best
and what is inferior in the publications to which
we have been referring; and, in truth, the difference
is one not of degree but in kind. As our
desire is, in Swift's phrase, to lash the vice but
spare the name, we shall not specify the works
which we have selected as typical of log-rolling
in relation to education. Till we saw them we
had no conception of the lengths to which this
sort of thing has run. Ostensibly the works
before us are critical and biographical monographs
designed to become text-books for
students of English literature; they may be
more correctly described as complete epitomes
of the art of puffery. The writers begin by
assuming that the objects of their ludicrous
adulation—who are, like themselves, contributors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140" href="#Page_140">[140]</a></span>
of the average order to current periodicals,
and the authors of monographs similar to their
own—are by general consent critics of classical
authority. The most deferential references are
made to them in almost every page. Now it is
"Goethe and Mr. So-and-so have observed," or
"Coleridge has remarked, but Mr. So-and-so is
inclined to think," etc. Sometimes it assumes
the form of a sort of awful reverence, as "Mr.
So-and-so is a little uncertain, but surely he
more than hints," or "Mr. So-and-so, as we all
know, was once of opinion, though he has recently
found reason to alter," etc. We saw not
long ago in the notes to a certain edition of a
classical author: "Socrates and Mr. X&mdash;&mdash; <i>of
Trinity</i> have observed," etc. Occasionally this
homage expresses itself—and this is more serious—in
the form of long extracts from Mr. So-and-so's
writings. Nothing is more common in
works like these than to find critics and writers
of classical authority either completely ignored,
or, if cited at all, cited only in the connection
which we have indicated. That the gentlemen
who are the subjects of this grotesque flattery
either have paid or will pay their friends in
kind may, of course, be taken for granted.
Thus one factitious reputation builds up another,
and one bad book ushers in twenty which are
worse.</p>

<p>Macaulay has an amusing passage in which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141" href="#Page_141">[141]</a></span>
has collected the names of those who, according
to Horace Walpole, were "the first writers" in
England in 1753. It might have been expected
that Hume, Fielding, Dr. Johnson, Richardson,
Smollett, Collins, and Gray would at least have
had a place among them. Not at all. They were
Lord Bath, Mr. W. Whithed, Sir Charles Williams,
Mr. Soame Jenyngs, Mr. Cambridge, and
Mr. Coventry; in other words, a clique of politicians
and men of fashion of the very titles of
whose writings even a reader tolerably well
read in the literature of those times might excusably
be ignorant. We are not exaggerating
when we say that this system of strenuous and
well-directed mutual puffery is, in our own
time, leading to similarly perverted conceptions
about the relative position of those who owe
their celebrity to these ignoble arts and those
on whose fame Time's test has set its seal, not
merely on the part of the general public, but on
the part of those who are responsible for the
books introduced into schools and educational
institutes. We will give an illustration.</p>

<p>At a meeting held not long ago, for the purpose
of prescribing books for a Reading Society,
the choice lay between some of Johnson's
Lives, Select Essays by Sainte Beuve, and Select
Essays by Matthew Arnold on the one hand,
and on the other certain books typical of the
literature of which we have been speaking.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142" href="#Page_142">[142]</a></span>
The debate which ensued was very amusing.
A member of the committee, a gentleman of
conservative temper, strongly urged the claims
of Johnson, Sainte Beuve, and Arnold, on the
ground that it was the duty of the Society to
encourage the study of what was excellent and
of classical quality, especially in criticism; that
it was not merely the information contained in
a book which had to be considered, but the
style, the tone, the touch; that the monographs
proposed as an alternative could scarcely
be regarded as of the first order, either in expression
or in matter, for he had observed,
though he had only glanced at them, several
solecisms in grammar and several inaccuracies
of statement; and he concluded by adding that
other writings of these particular authors with
which he happened to be more familiar had not
prejudiced him in their favour. Upon that,
another member of the council, who had been
busily conning the Press notices inserted in the
monographs in question, pleaded their claim
to preference. "Dr. Johnson," he remarked,
"was no doubt a great man in his day, but his
day had long been over; no one read him now.
Sainte Beuve and Matthew Arnold might be
classical and all that, but they were not up to
date." He could not talk as an expert on
literary matters, and therefore he would not
contradict what the former speaker had said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143" href="#Page_143">[143]</a></span>
"but there could be no doubt that Messrs. So-and-so,"
the authors of the monographs in question,
"were very big men—bigger men, I should
think (glancing at the Press notices in his hand),
than Sainte Beuve and Matthew Arnold. At
any rate, everybody has heard of them; and,"
he continued, "listen to this." He then proceeded
to read out some of the notices, adding
that it was difficult, if he might say so without
offence, to reconcile what his friend, the preceding
speaker, had said with what was said in
these notices. He was a little staggered—for,
though a simple, he was a shrewd man—when
the very remarkable similarity between Mr. A's
eulogies of Mr. B and Mr. B's eulogies of Mr. A
was pointed out to him, and when, in reference
to anonymous testimony, he was reminded that
one voice may have many echoes. It was
generally felt, more especially as Mr. A or
Mr. B had, we believe, more than one acquaintance
among the committee, that the debate
was taking rather an embarrassing turn. The
question was then put to the vote, and the
monographs were carried by a majority of
three to one.</p>

<p>What occurred at this meeting is occurring
every day, variously modified, wherever the
choice of books is in question, whether in public
libraries or in educational institutions. A literature,
the sole credentials of which are derived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144" href="#Page_144">[144]</a></span>
from those who produce and circulate it, is
gradually superseding that of our classics. We
seem in truth to be losing all sense of the
essential distinction between the writings of
the average man of letters and those of the
masters.</p>

Essay towards Selection, with Short Introductions. By
Frank W. Raffety, London.</p></div>


<p>Were it not for its melancholy significance,
this would be one of the most amusing
books which it has ever been our fortune to
meet with. Of Mr. Frank W. Raffety we have
not the honour to know anything, except what
we have gathered from this little volume and
from its title-page. But he must be a singularly
interesting gentleman. His enthusiasm for
books, his portentous ignorance of them; his
strenuous desire to improve the popular taste
by pleading for the best, his instinctive tendency
to make in all cases for the worst; his sublime
intolerance of everything in literature which
falls short of excellence, his more than sublime
indifference to the commonest rules of grammar
and syntax in expressing that intolerance; the
<i>naïveté</i>, the frankness, the recklessness with
which he displays his incompetence for the task
which he has undertaken—in these qualifications<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146" href="#Page_146">[146]</a></span>
and accomplishments Mr. Raffety is not perhaps
alone, but he has certainly no superior.</p>

<p>Mr. Raffety aspires to guide his readers
through the chief literatures of the world.
Now the task of a reviewer, who has a conscience,
is not always a cheerful one, and we
confess that, when we had generally surveyed
Mr. Raffety's work, we resolved to amuse ourselves
by trying to discover of which of the
literatures, to which Mr. Raffety constitutes
himself a guide, Mr. Raffety is probably most
ignorant. It is a nice point. Let our readers
judge. We will begin with Mr. Raffety and the
Classics. Of Theognis, the most voluminous of
the Greek Gnomic poets, it is said that "only
a few sentences"—Mr. Raffety is presumably
under the impression that Theognis wrote in
prose—"quoted in the works of Plato and others
survive." "The Greek Anthology," we are
astounded to learn, "is by Lord Neaves" and
"is one of the best volumes in the A.C.E.R.
series." What Mr. Raffety no doubt means is,
that Lord Neaves is the author of a monograph
on the Greek anthology, as he certainly was.
With regard to Herodotus, Mr. Raffety has
evidently got some information not generally
accessible. His <i>History</i>, we are told, "is a great
prose epic.... The second book is of the
most interest. In other works are the histories
of Crœsus, Cyrus," etc. It would be interesting
to know what other works besides his <i>History</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147" href="#Page_147">[147]</a></span>
Herodotus has left. Of the <i>Prometheus Bound</i>
of Æschylus Mr. Raffety gives the following
interesting account. It contains, he says, "the
story of Prometheus and his defiance of Jupiter,
who condemned him to be bound to a rock,
where he died rather than yield." We exhort
Mr. Raffety, before his work passes into a second
edition, to consult his Classical Dictionary.</p>

<p>Of the translations recommended by Mr.
Raffety we should very much like to get a
sight of the translation of Pindar by Calverley,
of the joint translation of the same classic by
Messrs. E. Myers and A. Lang, and of the joint
translation of Thucydides "by Jowett and Rev.
H. Dale, 2 vols." Of Herodotus, of Æschylus,
of Sophocles, of Pindar, of Polybius, of Demosthenes,
what are, by general consent, esteemed
the best translations are not so much as mentioned.
Latin literature fares even worse in
the hands of our guide. Mr. Raffety appears
to know no more about Catullus than that he
was a writer of epigrams. Such trifles as the
<i>Attis</i>, the <i>Peleus and Thetis</i>, the Julia and
Manlius marriage song, the <i>Coma Berenices</i>, the
love lyrics and threnodies he does not condescend
to notice. In "guiding" his readers to
translations of Lucretius and Juvenal, Munro's
version of the first in prose and Gifford's version
of the second in verse—which Conington pronounced
to be the best version of any Roman
classic in our language—are not so much as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148" href="#Page_148">[148]</a></span>
referred to. Nor, again, in the case of Plautus
and Terence, are the excellent versions of Thornton
and Coleman noticed. Tacitus, who is oddly
described as "the foremost man of the day,"
an estimate which might have pleased but
which would certainly have surprised him,
chronicled, we are told, "the foundation of the
Christian religion." Mr. Raffety's assurance on
this point will probably disappoint inquisitive
readers. Equally surprising are the portions of
the work dealing with the modern literatures.
In the course of these we learn that "the <i>Nibelungen
Lied</i> is the oldest drama in Europe";
that the <i>Areopagitica</i> and the <i>Defence of the
People of England</i> are Milton's best prose writings—Mr.
Raffety apparently not being aware
that the second work is in Latin, and that if
he means the first <i>Defence</i>, it is anything but
one of the best of Milton's writings. We are
also informed that Dryden was most valuable
as a translator from the Greek and Latin;
Dryden's versions from the Greek begin and
end with paraphrases of four Idylls of Theocritus,
the first book of the <i>Iliad</i> and the parting
of Hector and Andromache from the sixth, and
are notoriously the very worst things he ever
did.</p>

<p>Sometimes Mr. Raffety fairly takes our breath
away, as when he informs us that Gray's tomb
can be seen in the little churchyard of Stoke Pogis
"with the <i>Elegy</i> written upon it." Can Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149" href="#Page_149">[149]</a></span>
Raffety be acquainted with the length of the
<i>Elegy</i> and with the proportions of a tombstone?
Chaucer, we are informed, wrote some
poems in Italian. We should very much like to
see them, and so probably would Professor Skeat,
for they appear to have escaped the notice of
all Chaucer's editors. Swift's <i>Tale of a Tub</i>
was written, we are told, "against the teaching
of Hobbes!"</p>

<p>It is indeed impossible to open this book anywhere
without alighting on some most discreditable
blunder or absurdity. Thus we are informed
that Macaulay's essay on Burleigh treats of the
time of James I.—Burleigh, as we need hardly
say, dying nearly five years before James came
to the throne, and Macaulay's essay having no
reference at all to James I.'s time. "There is,"
says Mr. Raffety, "no more stirring lyric than
<i>The Cotter's Saturday Night</i>," a remark which
shows that Mr. Raffety does not know what a
lyric poem is. But to look for blunders in Mr.
Raffety's pages would be to look for leaves in
a summer forest. His critical remarks and biographical
notes are truly delightful. We wish
we had space to quote some of them. Of their
general quality the following profound remark
is a fair specimen:—"Dante requires study, and
an endeavour after appreciation." Mr. Raffety
is always anxious to conduct his readers by
short cuts and to save them trouble. Macaulay's
<i>Essays</i>, for example, should be read before his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150" href="#Page_150">[150]</a></span>
<i>History</i>; "they will be more easily tackled,"
he says, "than the <i>History</i> in the first instance."
But on the subject of Gibbon Mr.
Raffety is adamant, being fully of the late Professor
Freeman's opinion—"Whatever else is
read, Gibbon must be read." How Gibbon is to
be read, or why Gibbon is to be read, or in what
edition he should be read, Mr. Raffety does not
explain.</p>

<p>Now, what possible end can be served by
books like these, except to misguide and misinform?
Here is a writer, who certainly leaves
us with the impression that he cannot read the
Greek and Latin classics in the original, setting
up as a director of classical study, and pronouncing
<i>ex cathedrâ</i> on the merits of translations
of these classics. His knowledge of the
modern literature is, as is abundantly manifest,
though we have neither space nor patience to
illustrate, equally insufficient and unsubstantial,
and yet he undertakes to initiate and guide the
inexperienced in these studies. This book is
presented to the public in a most attractive
form, being excellently printed on excellent
paper, and will naturally be taken seriously by
those to whom it appeals. It is for this reason
that we also have felt it our duty to take it
seriously. And, as we believe that every bad
book stands in the way of a good one, we can
promise Mr. Raffety, and writers like Mr. Raffety,
that we shall continue to take them seriously.</p>

Le Gallienne. 2 vols.</p></div>


<p>Nearly two thousand years ago Horace
observed that, though every calling presupposed
some qualification in those who followed
it, and a man who knew nothing of
marine affairs would not undertake to manage
a ship, or a man who knew nothing of drugs to
compound prescriptions, yet everybody fancied
himself competent to commence poet. Qualified
or unqualified, at it we all go, he complains, and
scribble verses. But times have changed, and
those who in Horace's day were the pests of
poetry, with which they could amuse themselves
without mischief, have now become the pests
of another kind of literature in which their
diversions are not quite so harmless. Where
the poetaster once stood the criticaster now
stands. The transformation of the one pest
into the other, where they do not, as they often
do, become both, is easily accounted for, and as
Dr. Johnson has so excellently explained it, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152" href="#Page_152">[152]</a></span>
cannot do better than transcribe his words.
"Criticism," says the Doctor, "is a study by
which men grow important and formidable at
a very small expense. The power of invention
has been conferred by nature upon few, and the
labour of learning those sciences which may by
mere labour be attained is too great to be willingly
endured; but every man can exert such
judgment as he has upon the works of others,
and he whom nature has made weak and idleness
keeps ignorant may yet support his vanity by
the name of critic." But criticasters and their
patrons have improved on this—for "he whom
nature has made weak and idleness keeps ignorant"
may, in our time, not merely support his
vanity, but support himself.</p>

<p>Till we inspected the volumes before us, we
had really no conception of the pass to which
things have now come in so-called criticism.
The writer sits in judgment on most of the
authors who have, during recent years, been
before the public. He passes sentence not
merely on current novelists, poets, and essayists,
but on some of our classics, and on books like
the late Mr. Pater's <i>Lectures on Plato and
Platonism</i> and Dr. Wharton's edition of <i>Sappho</i>.
To any acquaintance with the principles of
criticism, to any conception of criticism in
relation to principles, to any learning, to any
scholarship, to any knowledge of the history of
literature and of the masterpieces of literature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153" href="#Page_153">[153]</a></span>
either in our own language or in other languages,
he has not the smallest pretension. Nor
does he allow this to be gathered simply from
the work itself, where it is, needless to say,
abundantly apparent, but with a <i>naïveté</i> and
impudence which are at once ludicrous and exasperating
he glories in his ignorance. Literature
and its interpretation are to him what the
Bible and its interpretation were to the ranting
sectaries of Dryden's satire. In its explanation
knowledge and learning were folly, nothing was
needed but "grace."</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"No measure ta'en from knowledge, all from grace,</div>
<div class="i0">Study and pains were now no more their care,</div>
<div class="i0">Texts were explained by fasting and by prayer."</div></div></div>

<p>So to our critic knowledge and learning are of
equal unimportance—nay, equally contemptible—and
all that is needed to take the measure of
Plato and Wordsworth is, in his own words,
"the capacity for appreciation." With this very
slender outfit he sits down to the work of criticism,
to enlighten the world <i>de omni scibili</i> in
literature, from the lyrics of <i>Sappho</i>, "the singer,
a single petal of whose rose is more than the
whole rose-garden of later women singers," to
"the statesmanlike reach and grasp" of Mr. E.
Gosse's essays.</p>

<p>To discuss seriously the opinions or impressions
of a writer of this kind would be as absurd
as to attempt to fight gnats with a sword, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154" href="#Page_154">[154]</a></span>
we shall merely content ourselves with transcribing,
without comment, a few of the aphorisms
with which these volumes are studded. "Criticism
is the art of praise." "Shakespeare is the
greatest English poet, not because he created
Hamlet and Lear, but because he could write
that speech about Perdita's flowers and Claudio's
speech on death in <i>Measure for Measure</i>."
"The perfection of prose is the essay, of poetry
the lyric, and the most beautiful book is that
which contains the most beautiful words." These
specimens will probably suffice. Mr. Le Gallienne
is also of opinion that "culture is mainly
a matter of temperament"—that "a man is
born cultured," that mere education and study
are to such a one not simply superfluities, but
impertinences. "What matters it," he eloquently
asks, "that one does not remember or
even has never read great writers? Our one
concern is to possess an organization open to
great and refined impressions." A paltry scholar,
for example, may be able to construe Sappho,
but it is only "an organization open to great
and refined impressions" which can discern (in
a crib) "the pathos of eternity in some twenty
words" of "this passionate singer of Lesbos."
Plato may be studied by poor pedants, but to an
organization of this kind the binding of a volume
is sufficient enlightenment; "to merely hold in
the hand and turn over its pages is a counsel in
style," for do not "the temperate beauty, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155" href="#Page_155">[155]</a></span>
dry beauty beloved of Plato, find expression in
the sweet and stately volume itself" [he is "reviewing"
the late Mr. Pater's lectures on Plato],
"with its smooth night-blue binding, its rose-leaf
yellow pages, its soft and yet grave type"?
The value of Mr. Le Gallienne's judgments, of
his praise, and of his censure, which, ludicrous
to relate, are quoted by some publishers as
recommendations, or "opinions of the press,"
may be estimated by these dicta, and by this
theory of a critical education.</p>

<p>Macaulay somewhere speaks of a certain nondescript
broth which, in some Continental inns,
was kept constantly boiling, and copiously poured,
without distinction, on every dish as it came up
to table. The writer of these essays appears,
metaphorically speaking, to be provided with a
similar abomination. Whatever be his theme,
poem, essay, novel, picture, he contrives to serve
it up with the same condiment, a sickly and
nauseous compound of preciosity and sentimentalism.</p>

<p>The melancholy thing about all this is the
profound unconsciousness on the part of the
author of these volumes that he is exciting
ridicule; that he is, in Shakespeare's phrase,
making himself a motley to the view. But
there are considerations more melancholy still.
We should not have noticed these volumes had
they not been representative and typical of a
school of so-called critics which is becoming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156" href="#Page_156">[156]</a></span>
more and more prominent. Incredible as it
may seem, there are certain sections of literary
society and of the general public which take
Mr. Le Gallienne and his dicta quite seriously,
and to which the prodigious nonsense in these
volumes does not present itself as absurdity, but
as the articles of a creed. These essays have,
moreover, appeared in publications the names of
some of which carry authority. It is, therefore,
high time that some stand should be made, some
protest entered against writings which cannot
fail to corrupt popular taste and to degrade the
standard of popular literature. Of one thing
we are very certain, that no self-respecting
literary journal which undertook to review
these volumes could allow them to pass without
denunciation.</p>

<p>Of Mr. Le Gallienne we know nothing personally.
He is, if we are rightly informed, still
a young man, and we would in all kindness
exhort him to turn the abilities which he undoubtedly
possesses to better account. There is
much in these essays which shows that he was
intended for something better than to further the
decadence. If, instead of sneering at scholars,
affecting to despise learning and study, indulging
in silly paradoxes, tinsel epigrams, and absurd
generalisations, he would read and think, and
endeavour to do justice to himself and to his
opportunities, he might, we make no doubt,
obtain an honourable reputation. There is much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157" href="#Page_157">[157]</a></span>
which is attractive in his work, and in the
personality reflected in it. He is not a charlatan,
for though he is ignorant, he is honest.
Genial and sympathetic, he has much real
critical insight, and, in going through his
volumes, we have noted many remarks which
were both sound and fine. At its best his style
is excellent,—clear, lively, and engaging. Let
him cease to play the buffoon, which can only
end in his gaining the applause of mere fools
and the contempt of every one else.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_GENTLE_ART_OF_SELF-ADVERTISEMENT" id="THE_GENTLE_ART_OF_SELF-ADVERTISEMENT">
</a>THE GENTLE ART OF SELF-ADVERTISEMENT</h2>


<p>The illustrious Barnum once observed that,
if a man's capital consisted of a shilling,
one penny of that shilling should be spent in
purchasing something, and the remaining eleven-pence
should be invested in advertising what was
purchased. There was, perhaps, a touch of exaggeration
in that great man's remark, but it
was founded on a profound knowledge both of
human nature and of the world. Intrinsically
nothing is valuable; things are what we make
or imagine them. Even the diamond, as a costly
commodity, exists on suffrage. If a man cannot
persuade his fellow-creatures that he has genius,
talent, learning, "'twere all alike as if he had
them not." What Persius asks with a sneer,
"Scire tuum nihil est, nisi te scire hoc sciat
alter?"—is your knowledge nothing, unless some
one else know that you are knowing?—a wiser
man would ask in all seriousness. Shakespeare
was never nearer the truth than when he
wrote—<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159" href="#Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i3">"No man is the lord of anything,</div>
<div class="i0">Though in and of him there be much consisting,</div>
<div class="i0">Till he communicates his parts to others;</div>
<div class="i0">Nor doth he of himself know them for aught,</div>
<div class="i0">Till he behold them formed in the applause</div>
<div class="i0">Where they are extended."</div></div></div>

<p>And never was a man more mistaken than
the old preacher who said to his congregation,
"If you have a talent in your napkin, you
should take care not to hide it; but if you have
no talent, but only a napkin, you should not so
flourish your napkin as to create the impression
that it is full of talents." Why, this is just what
nine men in ten who court fame have to do.
Nature is kind, but seldom profuse. If she
really endows a man with what, if trumpeted,
would make him famous, the odds are she
couples with her gifts pride, modesty, or self-respect,
which, to say the least, heavily handicap
him in the race for reputation. When she does
not endow with the reality, she compensates by
bestowing the power of acquiring the credit for
it. She is, as a rule, much too thrifty to heap
on the same man the keen pleasures of genuine
enthusiasm and the sweets of popular applause.
An impartial mother, she loves all her children,
and divides her favours equally between shams
and true men. This Churchill marks in his
brutal way; speaking of a certain contemporary,
he describes him as endowed with</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"That low cunning which in fools supplies,</div>
<div class="i0">And amply too, the place of being wise,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160" href="#Page_160">[160]</a></span>
<div class="i0">Which Nature, kind, indulgent parent, gave</div>
<div class="i0">To qualify the blockhead for a knave."</div></div></div>

<p>But our business is not with knaves and blockheads,
but with "gentler cattle," and the quotation
demands an apology.</p>

<p>The importance of the art of self-advertisement,
as must be abundantly clear from the
preceding remarks, can scarcely be overestimated.
Though it is perhaps still in its infancy,
its progress during the last few years has been
most encouraging. The old coarse methods so
familiar to us in the past, and still successfully
practised in the present—we mean mutual admiration
cliques, log-rolling, and what is vulgarly
known as "pulling the strings"—have
been greatly improved upon and refined. Bentley's
famous remark when, explaining how it
was that he took to commentating, he said,
that as he despaired of standing on his own
legs in the Temple of Fame, he got on to the
shoulders of the Ancients, appears to have
suggested one of the most ingenious of modern
expedients. This consists of "getting up" a
memorial to some distinguished man—a statue,
it may be, or modest bust. Some labour, some
ability, and some learning are involved in the
more cumbrous device of Bentley. But here
all is simple and very easy. You are on the
shoulders of your great man at a bound, and
stand side by side with him in a trice. There
is nothing which redounds to his credit which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161" href="#Page_161">[161]</a></span>
does not redound to your own. As the Red
Indian is under the impression that in possessing
himself of a scalp he possesses himself of
the virtues belonging to the former owner of
the scalp, so this tribute of enthusiastic admiration
quietly assumes, without trouble, all that
enthusiastic admiration naturally implies. Is
the object of your homage a poet, a critic, a
scholar, the very fact that you pay him homage
is, in itself, testimony of your own right to one
or other of these honourable titles. If, moreover
it should happen that you know very little
about the writings of the author whom you have
elected to honour, this is of no consequence; for
of all the disguises which ignorance can assume,
"enthusiasm" is the most effective. Nor are
these the only advantages of this particular
method of getting reputation. The collection of
subscriptions and the formation of a committee
bring you into contact, or may, if judiciously
managed, bring you into contact with all your
distinguished contemporaries; and we know
what the proverb says—"Noscitur a sociis"—a
man is what his companions are.</p>

<p>But nothing is more effectual, for purposes of
self-advertisement, than a device which has lately
been practised with signal success. This consists
of scraping up an acquaintance with some person,
whose name is not unknown to the public,—even
a second-rate novelist will do—and waiting
till he dies. As there is a tide in the affairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162" href="#Page_162">[162]</a></span>
of men, so, as we all know, there is a moment
at the demise of literary men when the voracity
of public curiosity knows neither distinction nor
satiety. This is the moment for the self-advertiser
to nick; this is the time for him to float,
with his defunct friend, on the lips of men. He
will find readers for anything he may choose to
print—that letter with its exquisite compliments,
that conversation in which his poor
attainments were so generously over-estimated,
or the importance of his slight literary services
so much exaggerated. Of course, the value of
such advertisements will be in proportion to the
eminence of the subject of the reminiscences—and
happy, thrice happy, those who were able to
turn men like Darwin, Tennyson, and Browning
to this account; their reputation may be regarded
as made. But it is not always necessary
to wait till great men die, though it is an experiment
too bold and perilous for most aspirants
to make this sort of capital out of them
while they are still alive. Still <i>audentes fortuna
juvat</i>, and it has been done. A certain minor
poet published in an American magazine, not
many years ago, an article entitled "A Day with
Lord Tennyson," in which he represented the
Laureate as turning the conversation on his
(the minor bard's) poetry. We are told how the
great man, after fervently reiterating a stanza
of that minor bard which pleased him, requested
his son to take it down in writing; how that son,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163" href="#Page_163">[163]</a></span>
though the day was cold and blowy, took it
down; how Tennyson grasped, at parting, his
brother poet's hand, and begged in transport
that he would "come again and come often."
He came, we believe, no more. But what of
that? He had accomplished a feat so simple
and yet so original that it may fairly be questioned
whether what Mr. Burnum used to call
his masterpiece was in any way comparable to
it. To interview a great man, even on an assumption
of equality, is, as we all know, a comparatively
easy matter, but to turn the conversation
of the great man into a seasonable puff
of yourself requires a combination of qualities
not often united in a single person. The worst
of feats like these is that they must have a tendency
to make great men a little shy of encouraging
the acquaintance of those to whom
they can be so useful. But simplicity, as Thucydides
remarks, is one of the chief ingredients of
greatness, and it is a quality very difficult to
wear out.</p>

<p>If Tennyson's interviewer has ever had a rival
in the important art which has been discussed—for
the benefit of youthful ambition—in this
article, we are inclined to think that that rival
was the Rev. Aris Willmott. This now almost
forgotten writer was a very voluminous author
both in verse and prose; but his merits were
not appreciated by an ungrateful public so much
as they ought to have been. He resorted, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164" href="#Page_164">[164]</a></span>
to the following exquisitely ingenious device.
He published a handsome volume, which
is now before us, entitled <i>Gems from English
Literature</i>, thus arranged: Bacon, Rev. Aris
Willmott, Jeremy Taylor, Rev. Aris Willmott,
Barrow, Rev. Aris Willmott, sandwiching himself
regularly through the prose classics, and in
the same way through the poets—Shakespeare,
Rev. Aris Willmott, Milton, Rev. Aris, etc. As
birthday books, press notices, interviews at
home, portraits of distinguished authors in their
studies, and the like are getting a little stale,
we cordially recommend this rev. gentleman's
expedient—it may be judiciously modified—to
the notice of all who are unable to distinguish
fame from notoriety.</p>

Friends.</i> Selected and Edited with Notes and Introduction
by Sidney Colvin. 2 vols.</p></div>


<p>The late Robert Louis Stevenson is a writer
who has every title to commiseration, and
the appearance of the volumes before us may be
said to mark the climax of his misfortunes.
Diseased and sickly from his birth, with his life
frequently hanging on a thread, he probably
never knew the sensation of perfect health.
During the impressionable years of early youth
his surroundings appear to have been most uncongenial;
he was forced into a profession for
which he had no taste and no aptitude. In
constant straits for money, at times he was
miserably poor; his apprenticeship to letters
was long and arduous, for he was not one of
Nature's favourites, and attained what he did
attain by unsparing and severe labour. His
wandering and restless life, bringing him as it
did into contact with all phases of humanity and
with all parts of the world, was of course in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166" href="#Page_166">[166]</a></span>
many respects favourable to his work, but it
had at the same time serious disadvantages. It
gave him little time for reflection; it imported
a certain feverishness into his energy, and
rendered that concentration and steadiness,
without which no really great work can be
accomplished, impossible. That in these circumstances
Stevenson should have produced so
much, and so much which is of a high order
of merit, is most creditable to him, and not a
little surprising. "He stands," says his friend
Professor Colvin, "as the writer who in the last
quarter of the nineteenth century has handled
with the most of freshness and inspiriting power
the widest range of established literary forms—the
moral, critical and personal essay, travels
sentimental and other, parables and tales of
mystery, boys' stories of adventure, memoirs;
nor let lyrical and meditative verse both English
and Scottish, and especially nursery verse, a
new vein for genius to work in, be forgotten."
With some reservation this may be conceded,
and this is as far as eulogy can legitimately be
stretched.</p>

<p>But, unhappily, some of Stevenson's admirers
have made themselves and their idol ridiculous,
by raising him to a position his claims to which
are preposterous. If he be measured with his
contemporaries the comparison will generally
be in his favour—he certainly did best what
hundreds can do well. His essays have distinction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167" href="#Page_167">[167]</a></span>
and excellence; his novels, travels, and
short tales, though scarcely entitled to the praise
of originality, as they strike no new notes and
are mere variants of the work of Scott, Kingston,
Ballantyne, De Quincey and Poe, bear the
impress of genius as distinguished from mere
talent, and reflect a very charming personality;
his verse, too, is pleasing and skilful. But when
we are told that he will stand the third in a trio
with Burns and Scott, and when we have to listen
to serious appeals to Edinburgh to raise a statue
to him beside the author of <i>Marmion</i> and the
Waverley Novels, all who truly appreciate his
work may well tremble for the reaction which is
certain to succeed such extravagant overestimation.
The truth is that poor Stevenson, himself
one of the simplest, sincerest and most modest
of men, got involved with a clique who may be
described as manufacturers of factitious reputations,—the
circulators of a false currency in
criticism. In these days of appeals to the masses
it is as easy to write up the sort of works which
are addressed to them—popular essays, tales and
novels—as it is to write up the commodities of
quack doctors and the shares of bogus companies.
The production of popular literature is
now a trade, and in some cases this kind of
puffery is the work of deliberate fraud, originating
from various motives. In many cases it
simply springs from ignorance and critical incompetence,
current criticism being, to a considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168" href="#Page_168">[168]</a></span>
extent, in the hands of very young men
who, having neither the requisite knowledge nor
the proper training, are unable to judge a writer
comparatively. In other cases it is to be attributed
to good nature and the tendency in the
genial appreciation of real merit to indulge in
extravagant expression. But the result is the
same. A reputation, so grotesquely out of proportion
to what is really merited that sober
people are inclined to suspect that all is imposture,
is gradually inflated. Eulogy kindles
eulogy; hyperbole is heaped on hyperbole; a
ludicrous importance is attached to every trifle
which falls, or which ever has fallen, from this
Press-created Fetish. While he is alive he is
encouraged, or rather importuned, to force his
power of production to keep pace with the
demand for everything bearing his signature;
when he is dead the very refuse of his study
finds eager publishers.</p>

<p>This kind of thing has obviously many advantages,
which are by no means confined to
the object of the idolatry itself. In the first
place it means business; it is the creation of a
goose which can lay golden eggs, and it is, in
the second place, a creation which reflects no
little glory on the creators. Is it nothing
to be the satellites of so radiant a luminary?
When the familiar correspondence of the great
man is printed, will not what he was pleased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169" href="#Page_169">[169]</a></span>
to say, with all the friendly license of private
intercourse, in the way of compliment and
eulogy, be proclaimed from the house-tops?</p>

<p>All this is exactly what has happened in the
case of poor Stevenson. No man ever took
more justly his own measure, or would have
been more annoyed at the preposterous eulogies
of which he has been made the subject,
on the part of interested or ill-judging friends.
We wonder what he would himself have said,
could he have seen the letters before us described,
as they were described in one of the
current Reviews, as "the most exhaustive and
distinguished literary correspondence which
England has ever seen." We entirely absolve
Professor Colvin from any suspicion of being
actuated by unworthy motives in publishing
them. It is abundantly clear that he has not
published them to puff himself, that his labour
has been a labour of love, and that he believed
himself to be piously fulfilling a duty
to his friend. But they ought never to have
been given to the world. More than two-thirds
have nothing whatever to justify their
appearance in print, and merely show, what
will surprise those who knew Stevenson by his
literary writings, how vapid, vulgar and commonplace
he could be. In their slangy familiarity
and careless spontaneity they remind us
of Byron's, but what a contrast do these trivial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170" href="#Page_170">[170]</a></span>
and too often insipid tattlings present to Byron's
brilliance and point, his wit, his piquancy, his
insight into life and men! Only here and there,
in a touch of description, or in a casual reflection,
do we find anything to distinguish them
from the myriads of letters which are interchanged
between young men every day in the
year. Their one attraction lies in the glimpses
they reveal of Stevenson's own charming personality,
his kindliness, his sympathy, his great
modesty, his manliness, his transparent truthfulness
and honesty. It is amusing to watch him
with one of his correspondents who was evidently
endeavouring to establish a mutual exchange
of flattery. The urbane skill with which this
gentleman's persistently fulsome compliments
are either fenced or waived aside, the ironical
delicacy with which, when a return is extorted,
they are repaid, in a measure strictly adjusted to
desert and yet certain not to disappoint expectant
vanity, are quite exquisite. "The suns
go swiftly out," he writes to him, referring to
the death of Tennyson and Browning and
others, "and I see no suns to follow, nothing
but a universal twilight of the demi-divinities,
with parties like you and me beating on toy
drums, and playing on penny whistles about
glow-worms." The indignant letter to the <i>New
York Tribune</i>, in defence of James Payn, who
had been accused of plagiarising from one of
Stevenson's fictions, well deserves placing on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171" href="#Page_171">[171]</a></span>
permanent record, as an illustration of his
chivalrous loyalty to his friends.</p>

<p>We are sorry, we repeat, that these letters
have been given to the world. So far as
Stevenson's reputation is concerned they can
only detract from it. When they illustrate him
on his best side they merely emphasise what
his works illustrate so abundantly that further
illustration is a mere work of supererogation.
When they present him, as for the most part
they do, in dishabille, they exhibit him very
greatly to his disadvantage. If Professor Colvin
had printed about one-third of them, and retained
his excellent elucidatory introductions,
which form practically a biography of Stevenson,
he would have produced a work for which all
admirers of that most pleasing writer would
have thanked him. As it is, he has been guilty,
in our opinion, of a grave error of judgment.</p>

by J. T. T. Brown.</p></div>


<p>Among the worthies of the fifteenth century
there is no more interesting and picturesque
figure than the Poet-King of Scotland,
James I. Long before the poem on which his
fame rests was given to the world, tradition had
assigned him a high place among native makers,
and his countrymen had been proud to add to
the names of Dunbar and Douglas, of Henryson
and Lyndsay, the name of the best of their
kings. Great was their joy, therefore, when, in
1783, William Tytler gave public proof that the
good King's title to the laurel was no mere title
by courtesy, but that he had been the author of
a poem which could fairly be regarded as one of
the gems of Scottish literature. There cannot,
in truth, be two opinions about the <i>Kingis
Quair</i>. It is a poem of singular charm and
beauty, and, though it is modelled closely on
certain of Chaucer's minor poems, and is in
other respects largely indebted to them, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173" href="#Page_173">[173]</a></span>
no servile imitation; it bears the impress of
original genius, not so much in details and incident
as in tone, colour, and touch; it is a
brilliant and most memorable achievement, and
Rossetti hardly exaggerates when he describes
it as</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"More sweet than ever a poet's heart</div>
<div class="i0">Gave yet to the English tongue."</div></div></div>

<p>For more than a hundred years it has been the
delight of all who care for the poetry of the
past, and the story it tells, and tells so pathetically,
is now among the "consecrated legends"
which every one cherishes. "The best poet
among kings, and the best king among poets,"
the name of the author of the <i>Kingis Quair</i>
heads the list of royal authors. The stanza
which he employed, though invented or adopted
by Chaucer, takes its title from the King, and
"the rime royal" will be in perpetual evidence
of his services to poetry, as the University of St.
Andrews will be of his services to learning and
education. No generation has passed, from Sir
Walter Scott to Mrs. Browning, and from Mrs.
Browning to Gabriel Rossetti, which has not
been lavish of honour and homage to him.</p>

<p>But, it seems, we have all been under a delusion.
Our simple ancestors believed that James
was the author of <i>Peebles to the Play</i> and
<i>Christ's Kirk on the Green</i>; but <i>Peebles to
the Play</i> and <i>Christ's Kirk on the Green</i>
"are now"—Mr. J. T. T. Brown is speaking—"relegated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174" href="#Page_174">[174]</a></span>
to the anonymous poetry of the
sixteenth century, inexorably deposed by the
internal evidence"; and Mr. Brown aspires to
send the <i>Kingis Quair</i> the same way. His
fell purpose is "to deprive James of his singing
garment, and reduce him to the humbler rank
of a King of Scots." There is something almost
terrible in the exultation with which Mr. Brown
assumes that—the King's claim to every other
poem attributed to him having been completely
demolished—it only remains to deprive him of
the <i>Kingis Quair</i>, to make his poetical bankruptcy
complete. And to the demolition of the King's
claim to the "Quair" Mr. Brown ruthlessly proceeds.
Now we have no intention of entering
into the question of the authenticity of the
minor poems to which Mr. Brown refers; but
we shall certainly break a lance with this
destructive critic in defence of James's claim
to the <i>Kingis Quair</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Brown contends, first, that there is no
satisfactory external evidence in favour of the
King's authorship of the poem; and, secondly,
that the internal evidence is almost conclusive
against him. What are the facts? In the Bodleian
Library is a MS. the date of which is uncertain,
but it cannot be assigned to an earlier
period than 1488. This MS. contains certain
poems of Chaucer, Hoccleve, Lydgate, and others,
together with the <i>Kingis Quair</i>. Of the <i>Kingis
Quair</i> it is, so far as is known, the only MS., and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175" href="#Page_175">[175]</a></span>
to it alone we owe the preservation of the poem.
Both title and colophon assign the work to
James I., the words being: "Heireefter followis
the quair Maid be King James of Scotland ye
first, callit ye Kingis quair, and Maid quhen his
Ma. wes in Ingland," the colophon running,
"Explicit, &amp;c., &amp;c., quod Jacobus primus scotorum
rex Illustrissimus." This is surely precise
enough; but Mr. Brown insists that the
statement carries very little weight, being no
more than the <i>ipse dixit</i> of not merely an
irresponsible, but of an unusually reckless copyist.
The recklessness of this copyist Mr. Brown
deduces from the fact that, of ten poems attributed
to Chaucer in the same MS., five undoubtedly
do not belong to him. On this we
shall only remark that it would be interesting
to know whether these poems have been attributed
to Chaucer in other MSS. In any case,
Mr. Brown must surely know that it is a very
different thing for a copyist to miss-assign a
few short poems and to make a statement so
explicit as the statement here made with regard
to the <i>Kingis Quair</i>. He must either
have been guilty of deliberate fraud—and
what right have we to assume this?—or he
must have been misled, an hypothesis which is
equally unwarrantable, unless it be adequately
supported. And how does Mr. Brown proceed
to support it? He contends that we have no
satisfactory evidence from other sources that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176" href="#Page_176">[176]</a></span>
James was the author of the poem. Walter
Bower, the one contemporary historian, though
he gives in his <i>Scotichronicon</i> an elaborate account
of the King's accomplishments, is silent,
Mr. Brown triumphantly observes, about his
poetry. This may be conceded. But Weldon is
equally silent about the poetry of James VI.,
and Buchanan about the poetry of Mary. And
what says the next historian, John Major? "In
the vernacular"—we give the passage in Mr.
Brown's own version—"he was a most skilful
composer.... He wrote a clever little
book about the Queen before he took her to
wife and while he was a prisoner," a plain
reference to the <i>Kingis Quair</i>. Testimony to
his poetical ability is also given by Hector Boyes
in his <i>History of Scotland</i>, "In linguâ vernaculâ
tam ornata faciebat carmina, ut poetam natum
credidisses." So say John Bellenden, John Leslie,
and George Buchanan. Of these witnesses
Mr. Brown coolly observes that they carry little
or no weight, because they only echo each other
and Major. Major, Mr. Brown insists, is "the
sole authority for the ascription to James of the
vernacular poems." Certainly fame in the face
of such critics as Mr. Brown is held on a very
precarious tenure. Dunbar, in his <i>Lament of
the Makaris</i>, enumerates, continues our critic,
twenty-one Scottish poets, but passes James
over in silence, therefore James's title to being
a poet was unknown to him. Possibly; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177" href="#Page_177">[177]</a></span>
that Dunbar's list was not meant to be exhaustive
is proved by the fact that he makes
no mention of a poet, and of a considerable poet,
who must have been well known to him, Thomas
of Ercildoune. Nothing can be more misleading
than deductions like these. Ovid has given us
an elaborate catalogue of the poets of his time,
but makes no mention of Manilius. Heywood
and Taylor have given elaborate catalogues of
the contemporary Elizabethan dramatists and
make no mention of Cyril Tourneur. Addison
has given us an account of the principal English
poets, and makes no mention of Shakespeare. If
Dante's and Chaucer's acquaintance with their
distinguished brethren is to be estimated by
those whom they noticed, it must have been far
more limited than we know it, by other evidence,
to have been. Lyndsay, again, is cited as testimony
of ignorance of James's title to rank
among poets; but in the list, in which he is silent
about James, he is silent about poets so famous
as Barbour, Blind Harry, Wyntown, Kennedy,
and Douglas.</p>

<p>Mr. Brown next proceeds to the question of
internal evidence. He cannot understand how
it could come to pass, that a Scotchman, who left
his native country when he was under twelve
years of age, and who was educated by English
tutors in England, should, after eighteen years
of exile, employ "the Lowland Scottish dialect."
This is surely not very difficult to explain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178" href="#Page_178">[178]</a></span>
Nothing so much endears his country to a man
as exile, and nothing is more cherished by a
patriot than his native language. Ten years'
exile among the Getæ did not corrupt the Latinity
of Ovid, and more than twenty years' exile
did not impair the purity of Thucydides' Attic.
The King may have had English tutors, but
Wyntown distinctly tells us that he was allowed
to retain, as his companions, four of his
countrymen. When he served in France he had
a Scottish bodyguard. The document in the
King's own handwriting, printed by Chalmers,
proves that in 1412 he was conversant with the
Lowland dialect. In all probability, therefore,
he carefully cherished his native language. The
consensus of tradition places it beyond all doubt
that he composed poetry in the vernacular, and
as he wrote the <i>Kingis Quair</i> when he knew
that he was about to return to Scotland as its
king, it was surely the most natural thing in the
world that he should compose a poem which told
the story of himself and his young bride, whom
he was introducing to his subjects as their queen,
in the language of the country. But, says Mr.
Brown, it is the Lowland dialect, with inflexions
peculiar to Midland English, with many
Chaucerian inflections engrafted on it. And
what more natural? The Midland dialect was
the dialect of his English teachers. The poems
of Chaucer he probably had by heart.</p>

<p>Mr. Brown's object in all this is to relegate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179" href="#Page_179">[179]</a></span>
the <i>Kingis Quair</i> to that group of poems
which are represented by the <i>Romaunt of the
Rose</i>, <i>The Court of Love</i>, and <i>Lancelot of the Lak</i>,
which appeared late in the fifteenth century,
and in which all these peculiarities are very
pronounced. Into philological details we have
not space to enter, but this we will say. We
will admit that <i>ane</i> before a consonant, the
past participle in <i>yt</i> or <i>it</i>, the pronouns <i>thaire</i>
and <i>thame</i>, the plural form <i>quhilkis</i>, the employment
of the verb <i>to do</i> in the emphatic conjugation
and the like, are peculiarities which belong
to a period not earlier than about 1440, and
that all these peculiarities are to be found in
the poem. But, we contend that these are just
as likely to be due to the transcriber as they
are to the author. Nothing was so common
with copyists as to import into their texts
the peculiarities of their own dialects, indeed it
was habitual with them. Thus Hampole's <i>Pricke
of Conscience</i> was greatly altered by southern
scribes. Thus, in the Bannatyne MS., Chaucer's
minor poems were similarly altered by northern
scribes. It is, in truth, the very height of rashness
to dispute the genuineness of an original, in consequence
of the presence of peculiarities which
might quite well have been imported into it by
a copyist. The resemblances between this poem
and the <i>Court of Love</i> are, we admit, not
likely to have been mere coincidences, and we
are quite ready to admit that the <i>Court of Love</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180" href="#Page_180">[180]</a></span>
in the form in which we have it now, must be
assigned to a much later date, more than a
century later, than the date (1423) assigned to
the <i>Kingis Quair</i>. But this is certain—that
many, and very many, of the resemblances
between the two poems are to be attributed
to the fact that the writers were saturated
with the influence of Chaucer, and delighted
in imitating and recalling his poetry. If,
again, it be assumed that one poem was the
exemplar of the other, this is indisputable, that
the <i>Court of Love</i> was modelled on the <i>Kingis
Quair</i>, and not the <i>Kingis Quair</i> on the <i>Court
of Love</i>. For, setting aside peculiarities which
may be assigned to transcribers, there can be
little doubt that the <i>Court of Love</i> belongs to
the sixteenth century at the very earliest,
while Mr. Brown himself admits that the MS.
of the <i>Kingis Quair</i> may be approximately
fixed at 1488.</p>

<p>Nothing can be more unsatisfactory than Mr.
Brown's attempt to show that the poem breaks
down in autobiographical details, and that it
derives these details from Wyntown's <i>Chronicle</i>.
James does not mention the exact year in which
he was taken prisoner. He tells us that he
commenced his voyage when the sun had begun
to drive his course upward in the sign of Aries,
that is, on or about the 12th of March—and that
he had not far passed the state of innocence,
"bot nere about the nowmer of zeris thre"—in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181" href="#Page_181">[181]</a></span>
other words, that he was about ten years of age.
Hereupon Mr. Brown, assuming that Wyntown
gives the date of the King's birth correctly, proceeds
to point out that the King was not at this
time "about ten," but that he was about eleven
and a half; and then asks triumphantly whether
James would have been likely to forget his own
age. Again, he contends that the King's capture
could not have taken place in March, because it
is highly probable that at the end of February,
or at the beginning of March, the King was in
the Tower. For the fact that he was in the
Tower at that date there is not an iota of proof,
or even of tolerably satisfactory presumptive
evidence. How the author of the <i>Kingis
Quair</i> could have been indebted to Wyntown's
<i>Chronicle</i> for the autobiographical details it is,
indeed, difficult to see. The poem gives March
as the date of the capture; the <i>Chronicle</i> gives
April. According to the poem, the King's age
at the time of his capture was about ten;
according to the <i>Chronicle</i>, about eleven and a
half. The <i>Chronicle</i> gives the year of the capture;
the poem does not. The <i>Chronicle</i> gives
details not to be found in the poem; the poem
details not to be found in the <i>Chronicle</i>. Mr.
Brown has no authority whatever for asserting
that Book IX. chap. xxv. of the <i>Chronicle</i> was
certainly written years before James returned
to Scotland. All we know about the <i>Chronicle</i>
is that it was finished between the 3rd of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182" href="#Page_182">[182]</a></span>
September, 1420, and the return of James in
April, 1424.</p>

<p>Mr. Brown must forgive us for expressing
regret that he should have wasted so much time
and learning, in attempting to support a paradox
which can only serve to perplex and mislead.
Scholars, especially in these days, would
do well to remember, that nothing can justify
destructive criticism but a conscientious desire,
on the part of those who apply it, to correct
error and to discover truth. And they would
also do well to ponder over Bacon's weighty
words: "Like as many substances in Nature
which are solid do putrify and corrupt into
worms, so it is the property of good and sound
knowledge to putrify and dissolve into a number
of subtle, idle, unwholesome, and, as I may
term them, vermiculate questions, which have
indeed a kind of quickness and life of spirit, but
no soundness of matter nor goodness of substance."</p>

<p>Boswell tells us that he once offered to
teach Dr. Johnson the Scotch dialect, that
the sage might enjoy the beauties of a certain
Scotch pastoral poem, and received for his reply,
"No, sir; I will not learn it. You shall retain
your superiority by my not knowing it." It
would not be true to say that Dr. Johnson's
indifference to the Scotch language and to
Scotch poetry has been shared by all cultivated
Englishmen, but it has certainly been shared by
a very large majority in every generation. The
superb merit of many of the Scotch ballads, the
lyrics of Burns and the novels of Scott have
practically done little to diminish this majority
and to induce English readers to acquire the
knowledge which Dr. Johnson disdained. Nine
Englishmen out of ten read Burns, either with
an eye uneasily fishing the glossary at the bottom
of the page, or <i>ad sensum</i>, that is, in contented
ignorance of about three words in every nine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184" href="#Page_184">[184]</a></span>
And this is, perhaps, all that can reasonably be
expected of the Southerner. Life is short; the
world of Scotch drink, Scotch religion and
Scotch manners is not, as Matthew Arnold observed,
a lovely one, and the time which such
an accomplishment would require would be far
more profitably spent in acquiring, say, the
language of Dante and Ariosto, or even the
language of the <i>Romancero General</i> and of Cervantes.
A modern reader may stumble, with
more or less intelligence, through a poem of
Burns, catching the general sense, enjoying
the lilt, and even appreciating the niceties of
rhythm. But this is not the case with the Scotch
of the fifteenth century—the golden age of the
vernacular poetry, the age when poets were
writing thus:—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"Catyvis, wrechis, and ockeraris,</div>
<div class="i0">Hud-pykis, hurdaris, and gadderaris,</div>

<div class="i0">Feyndis fild thame new up to the thrott</div>
<div class="i1">With gold of allkin prent."</div></div></div>

<p>The usual consequences have been the result
of this ignorance. The Scotch have had it all
their own way in estimating the merits of
their vernacular classics, <a name="Correct10" id="Correct10">and the few outsiders,
whether</a> English or German, who have made
the Scotch language and literature a special<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185" href="#Page_185">[185]</a></span>
subject of study, have very naturally not been
willing to underestimate the value of what it
has cost them labour to acquire, and so have
supported the exaggerated estimates of the
Scotch themselves. What Voltaire so absurdly
said of Dante, that his reputation was safe because
no intelligent people read him, is literally
true of such poets as Henryson, Douglas, and
Dunbar. We simply take them on trust, and,
as with most other things which are taken on
trust, we seldom trouble ourselves about the
titles and guarantees. It may be accepted as
an uncontrolled truth that the world is always
right, and very exactly right, in the long
run. That mysterious tribunal which, resolved
into the individuals which compose it, seems
resolved into every conceivable source of ignorance,
error, and folly, is ultimately infallible.
There are no mismeasurements in the reputation
of authors with whom readers of every
class have been familiar for a hundred years.
But, in the case of minor writers who appeal
only to a minority, critical literature is the
record of the most preposterous estimates. The
history of the building up of these pseudo-reputations
is generally the same in all cases.
First we have the <i>obiter dictum</i> of some famous
man whose opinion naturally carries authority,
uttered, it may be, carelessly in conversation,
or committed, without deliberation, to paper, in
a letter or occasional trifle. Then comes some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186" href="#Page_186">[186]</a></span>
little man, who takes up in deadly seriousness
what the great man has said, and out comes,
it may be, an essay or article. This wakes
up some dreary pedant, who follows with an
"edition" or "Study," which naturally elicits
from some kindred spirit a sympathetic review.
Thus the ball is set rolling, or, to change the
figure, bray swells bray, echo answers to echo,
and the thing is done. Meanwhile, all that is
of real interest and importance in the author
thus resuscitated is lost sight of; in advocating
his factitious claims to attention his real claims
are ignored. For the true point of view is
substituted a false, and the whole focus of
criticism, so to speak, is deranged. The first
requisite in estimating the work and relative
position of a particular author is the last thing
which these enthusiasts seem to consider, that
is, the application of standards and touchstones
derived not simply from the study of the author
himself, but from acquaintance with the principles
of criticism, and with what is excellent
in universal literature.</p>

<p>All this has been illustrated in the case of the
poet who is the subject of the volume before
us. As Mr. Ruskin has pronounced <i>Aurora
Leigh</i> to be the greatest poem of this century,
so Sir Walter Scott, who has, by the way,
been singularly unjust to Lydgate and Hawes,
pronounced Dunbar to be "a poet unrivalled
by any that Scotland has ever produced." a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187" href="#Page_187">[187]</a></span>
reckless judgment which he could never have
expressed deliberately. Ellis followed suit, and
in Ellis' notice Dunbar is "the greatest poet
Scotland has produced." These judgments have,
in effect, been reverberated by successive writers
and editors. In due time, some fourteen years
ago, appeared the inevitable German monograph,
"William Dunbar: sein Leben und seine
Gedichte," by Dr. J. Schipper, to whom Mr.
Oliphant Smeaton appropriately and reverently
inscribes the present monograph.</p>

<p>In Mr. Oliphant Smeaton's work Dunbar
assumes the proportions which might be expected—he
is a "mighty genius." "The peer,
if not in a few qualities, the superior of Chaucer
and Spenser. By the indefeasible passport
of the supreme genius he has an indisputable
title to the apostolic succession of British poetry
to that place between Chaucer and Spenser,
that place which can only be claimed by one
whose genius was co-ordinate with theirs." As
probably eight out of every ten of Mr. Smeaton's
readers will know nothing more of Dunbar than
what Mr. Smeaton chooses to tell them, and as
we, considering the space at our disposal, cannot
refute him by a detailed examination of
Dunbar's works, it is fortunate that he has
given us a succinct illustration of the value of
his critical judgment. The following are four
typical stanzas of a poem which Mr. Smeaton
ranks with Milton's <i>Lycidas</i> and Shelley's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188" href="#Page_188">[188]</a></span>
<i>Adonais</i>; we give them as Mr. Smeaton gives
them, modernised:—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"I that in health was and gladness</div>
<div class="i0">Am troubled now with great sickness.</div>
<div class="i0">Enfeebled with infirmity,</div>
<div class="i4"><i>Timor mortis conturbat me.</i></div>
<br />
<div class="i0">"Our pleasure here is all vain glory,</div>
<div class="i0">This false world is but transitory,</div>
<div class="i0">The flesh is brittle, the fiend is slee,</div>
<div class="i4"><i>Timor mortis conturbat me.</i></div>
<br />
<div class="i0">"The state of man doth change and vary,</div>
<div class="i0">Now sound, now sick, now blyth, now sary</div>
<div class="i0">Now dancing merry, now like to dee,</div>
<div class="i4"><i>Timor mortis conturbat me.</i></div>
<br />
<div class="i0">"No state on earth here stands sicker,</div>
<div class="i0">As with the wind waves the wicker,</div>
<div class="i0">So waves this world's vanity,</div>
<div class="i4"><i>Timor mortis conturbat me.</i>"</div></div></div>

<p>As the following is pronounced to be one of
the finest stanzas Dunbar ever penned, it is
interesting as illustrating what is, in Mr. Smeaton's
opinion, the best work of this rival of
Chaucer and Spenser:—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"Have mercy, love, have mercy, lady bright;</div>
<div class="i0">What have I wrought against your womankeid,</div>
<div class="i0">That you should murder me a sackless wight,</div>
<div class="i0">Trespassing on you nor in word nor deed?</div>
<div class="i0">That ye consent thereto, O God forbid;</div>
<div class="i0">Leave cruelty and save your man for shame,</div>
<div class="i0">Or through the world quite losëd is your name."</div></div></div>

<p>It may be added that what are by far the finest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189" href="#Page_189">[189]</a></span>
passages in Dunbar's poems are passed unnoticed
and unquoted by Mr. Smeaton. Indeed, his
acquaintance with Dunbar, or, at all events, his
taste in selection, is exactly on a par with that
of Ned Softley's with Waller. "As that admirable
writer has the best and worst verses among
our English poets, Ned," says Addison, "has got
all the bad ones by heart, which he repeats
upon occasion to show his reading." Should
Mr. Smeaton ever meet his idol in Hades, we
would in all kindness advise him to avoid an
encounter; let him remember that the fulsome
eulogy is his own, but that the verses quoted
are the poet's. Attempted murder—so the irate
shade might argue—is less serious than compulsory
suicide.</p>

<p>Dunbar was undoubtedly a man of genius,
but a reference to the poets who immediately
preceded him will make large deductions from
the praises lavished on him by his eulogists.
He struck no new notes. <i>The Thistle and the
Rose</i> and <i>The Golden Terge</i> are mere echoes of
Chaucer and Lydgate, and, in some degree, of
the author of <i>The King's Quair</i>, and are indeed
full of plagiarisms from them. <i>The Dance of
the Seven Deadly Sins</i> is probably little more
than a faithful description of a popular mummery.
His moral and religious poems had their
prototypes, even in Scotland, in such poets as
Johnston and Henryson. His most remarkable
characteristic is his versatility, which ranges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190" href="#Page_190">[190]</a></span>
from the composition of such poems as <i>The
Merle and the Nightingale</i> to the <i>Twa Maryit
Wemen and the Wedo</i>, from such lyrics as the
<i>Meditation in Winter</i> to such lyrics as the <i>Plea
for Pity</i>. Mr. Smeaton calls him "a giant in
an age of pigmies." The author or authoress of
<i>The Flower and the Leaf</i> was infinitely superior
to him in point of style, Henryson was infinitely
superior to him in originality, and Gavin Douglas
at least his equal in power of expression and
in description.</p>

<p>Let us do Dunbar the justice which Mr.
Smeaton has not done him, and take him at
his very best. Here is part of a picture of a
May morning,—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"For mirth of May, wyth skippis and wyth hoppis</div>
<div class="i0">The birdis sang upon the tender croppis,</div>
<div class="i1">With curiouse notis, as Venus Chapell clerkis.</div>
<div class="i0">The rosis yong, new spreding of their knoppis,</div>
<div class="i0">War powderit brycht with hevinly beriall droppis;</div>
<div class="i1">Throu bemes rede, birnyng as ruby sperkis,</div>
<div class="i1">The skyes rang for schoutyng of the larkis."</div></div></div>

<p>This is brilliant and picturesque rhetoric
touched into poetry by the "Venus Chapell
clerkis," and the magical note in the last line;
so too the touch in <i>The Golden Terge</i>, likening
the faery ship to "blossom upon the spray."
But in his allegorical poem he is too fond of
the "quainte enamalit termes," and his verse
has a certain metallic ring. It will be admitted,
we suppose, that the best of his moral poems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191" href="#Page_191">[191]</a></span>
would be <i>The Merle and the Nightingale</i> and
"Be Merrie Man"; but the utmost which can
be said for them is, that the philosophy is excellent
and its expression adequate; that is,
that they have little to distinguish them from
hundreds of other poems of the same class.</p>

<p>In speaking of Dunbar's satires, Mr. Smeaton
indulges himself in the following nonsense,
"From the genial, jesting, and ironical incongruities
of Horace and Persius we are introduced
at once into the bitter, vitriolic scourgings
of Juvenal," and in the following rhodomontade,
telling us that they unite "the natural directness
of Hall, the subtle depth of Donne, the
delicate humour of Breton, the sturdy vigour
of Dryden, the scalding, vitriolic bitterness of
Swift, the pungency of Churchill, the rural
smack of Gay, united to an approach at least
to the artistic perfection of Pope." Stuff like
this and indiscriminate eulogy are, no doubt,
much easier to produce than an estimate of a
writer's historical position and importance. Of
the relation of Dunbar to his predecessors and
contemporaries in England and Scotland, of his
prototypes and models in French and Provençal
literature, of the influence which he undoubtedly
exercised on subsequent poetry, and especially
on Spenser, Mr. Smeaton has nothing to say.
It never seems to occur to him that his hero,
like every one else, must have had his limitations,
that "the many-sidedness of that genius<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192" href="#Page_192">[192]</a></span>
which has a ring"—the metaphors are not ours,
but Mr. Smeaton's—"almost Shakespearian,
about it," could hardly have been distinguished
by uniformity of excellence; that "that painter
of contemporary manners, who had all the
vividness of a Callot, united to the broad
humour of a Teniers and the minute touch of
a Meissonier," who "reflected in his verse the
most delicate <i>nuances</i>, as well as the most
startling colours of the age wherein he lived,"
must have had degrees in success.</p>

<p>We have singled out this volume for special
notice, not because of any intrinsic title it
possesses to serious attention, but because it is
typical of a species of literature which is rapidly
becoming one of the pests of our time. While
every encouragement should be given to sober,
judicious, and competent reviews of our older
writers, every discouragement should be given,
out of respect to the dead, as well as in the
interests of the living, to such books as the
present. For they are as mischievous as they
are ridiculous. They misinform; they mislead;
they corrupt, or tend to corrupt, taste. After
laying down a volume like this we feel, and
we expect Dunbar would have felt, that there
is something much more formidable than the
old horror, "the candid friend," even that indicated
by Tacitus—<i>pessimum inimicorum genus—laudantes</i>.</p>

<i>A Literary History of the English People from the
Origins to the Renaissance.</i> By J. J. Jusserand.</p></div>


<p>There is a breeziness and hilarity, a gay
irresponsibility and abandon, about M.
Jusserand which is perfectly delightful. He is
the very Autolycus of History and Criticism.
What more sober students, who have some conscience
to trouble them, are "toiling all their
lives to find" appears to be his as a sort of
natural right. The fertility of his genius is
such, that it seems to blossom spontaneously
into erudition. Like the lilies he toils not, but
unlike the lilies he spins, and very pretty
gossamer too. It is impossible to take him
seriously.</p>

<p>The truth is that M. Jusserand belongs to a
class of writers which, thanks to indulgent
publishers, a more indulgent public, and most
indulgent reviewers, is just now greatly in the
ascendant. "Encyclopædical heads," who took
all knowledge for their province, probably died<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194" href="#Page_194">[194]</a></span>
with Bacon, but encyclopædical heads who take
all Literature or all History for their province
appear to be as common as the "excellence"
which, in opposition to Matthew Arnold's opinion,
the American lady maintained was so
abundant on both sides of the Atlantic. These
are the gentlemen who complacently sit down
"to edit the Literatures of the world," or "to
trace the development of the human race, from
its picturesque cradle in the valleys of Central
Asia, to its infinite ramifications in our own
day"—within "the moderate compass of an
octavo volume."</p>

<p>M. Jusserand's first feat is to dispose of some
six centuries in ninety-three pages, in a narrative
which simply tells over again, though certainly
after a more jaunty fashion, what Ten
Brink, Henry Morley, and others have told much
more seriously, and, we may add, much more
effectively. The Norman Conquest and an account
of the Anglo-Norman literature occupy
about a hundred and ten pages, while some
eighty pages more, dealing with the fusion of
the races and the gradual evolution of the English
people and language, bring us to Chaucer.
It might have been expected that M. Jusserand
would have justified his survey of a period so
often reviewed before, either by tracing, with
more fulness and precision than his predecessors,
the successive stages in the development of
our nationality and its expression in literature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195" href="#Page_195">[195]</a></span>
or by adding to our knowledge of the characteristics
and peculiarities of the literature itself.
He has done neither. He has, on the contrary,
obscured the first by the constant introduction
of irrelevant matter, and he has apparently no
notion of the relative importance of the authors
on whose works he dilates or touches. Thus
Richard Rolle of Hampole fills more space than
Layamon, whose work is despatched in a page!
Thus two lines in a note suffice for the <i>Ormulum</i>,
two lines for Mannyng's <i>Handlyng of Synne</i>, a
singularly interesting and significant work, ten
lines for Robert of Gloucester, who is rather
perplexingly described as "a distant ancestor of
Gibbon and Macaulay," while four pages are
accorded to <i>Tristan</i> and five to the <i>Roman du
Renart</i>. How the Latin Chroniclers fare may
be judged from the fact that a little more than
a page serves for Geoffrey of Monmouth, a line
for Ordericus Vitalis, and two for Giraldus
Cambrensis. In the chapter on Chaucer M.
Jusserand does more justice to his subject, and
it is to be regretted for his own sake that he
has not confined himself to such essays. He is
never safe except when he is on the beaten
path. Nothing could be more inadequate than
the section on Gower. It certainly indicates
that M. Jusserand is not very familiar with
the <i>Confessio Amantis</i>. Not one word is said
about the remarkable prologue, and to dismiss
such a work in less than three pages, observing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196" href="#Page_196">[196]</a></span>
that "it contains a hundred and twelve short
stories, two or three of which are very well
told, one, the adventure of Florent, being, perhaps,
related even better than in Chaucer," is
not quite what we should expect in a work purporting
to narrate the "literary history of the
English people." M. Jusserand has not even
taken the trouble to keep pace with modern
investigation in his subject, but actually tells
us that Gower's <i>Speculum Meditantis</i> is lost!
If Gower's writings are not of much intrinsic
value, they are of immense importance from
an historical point of view. John de Trevisa, a
most important name in the history of English
prose, is despatched in eight lines of mere bibliographical
information, without a word being said
about his great services to our literature, and
without any reference being made either to the
remarkable preface to his great work, or to his
version of the Dialogue attributed to Occam.</p>

<p>The only satisfactory chapter in the book is
the chapter dealing with Langland and his
works; but it is certainly surprising that no
account should be given of the very remarkable
anonymous poem entitled <i>Piers Ploughman's
Crede</i>. Again, whole departments of literature,
such as the Metrical Romances, the Laies, Fabliaux,
early lyrics and ballads, are most inadequately
treated, some of the most memorable
and typical being not even specified. Surely
Minot was not a man to be dismissed, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197" href="#Page_197">[197]</a></span>
flippant joke, in half a page, or <i>King Horn</i> and
<i>Havelok</i> poems to be relegated to passing reference
in a note.</p>

<p>But it is in dealing with the literature of the
fifteenth century that M. Jusserand's superficiality
and, to put it plainly, incompetence for his
ambitious task become most deplorably apparent.
In treating the earlier periods he had
trustworthy guides even in common manuals,
and he could not go far wrong in accepting
their generalizations and statements. Books
easily attainable, and indeed in everybody's
hands, could enable him to dance airily through
the Anglo-Saxon literature and through the
period between Layamon and Chaucer. No
one can now very well go wrong in Chaucer
and his contemporaries, who has at his side
some half-dozen works which any library can
supply. But it is otherwise with the literature
of the fifteenth century. Here, as every one
who happens to have paid particular attention
to it knows, popular manuals and histories are
most misleading guides. Deterred, no doubt,
by the prolixity of the poetry and by the comparatively
uninteresting nature of the prose
literature, modern historians and critics have
contented themselves with accepting the verdicts
of Warton and his followers, who probably
had as little patience as themselves; and
so a kind of conventional estimate has been
formed, which appears and reappears in every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198" href="#Page_198">[198]</a></span>
manual and handbook. We turned, therefore,
with much curiosity to this portion of M. Jusserand's
work. We had, we own, our suspicions
about his first-hand knowledge of the literature
through which he glided so easily in the earlier
portions of his book, and here, we thought,
would be the crucial test of his pretension to
original scholarship. Would he do voluminous
Lydgate the justice which, as the specialist
knows, has so long been withheld from him?
Would he point out the strong human interest
of Hoccleve; the great historical interest of
Hardyng; the power and beauty of the ballads;
or, if he included Hawes within the century,
would he show what a singularly interesting
poem, intrinsically and historically, the <i>Pastime
of Pleasure</i> really is? If, again, he included
the Scotch poets, how would he deal with the
problems presented by Huchown? Would he
accord the proper tribute to the genius of Dunbar;
would he estimate what poetry owes respectively
to James I., Henry the Minstrel,
Robert Henryson, and Gavin Douglas? In our
prose literature, would he comment on the great
importance of Pecock's memorable work, of
Fortescue's two treatises, of the <i>Paston Letters</i>,
of Caxton's various publications? How would
he deal with the one "classical" work of the
century, Malory's <i>Morte d'Arthur</i>?</p>

<p>Now, of Lydgate, "to enumerate whose
pieces," says Warton, "would be to write the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199" href="#Page_199">[199]</a></span>
catalogue of a little library," it is not too much
to say that he was one of the most richly gifted
of our old poets, that as a descriptive poet he
stands almost on the level of Chaucer, that his
pictures of Nature are among the gems of their
kind, that his pathos is often exquisite, "touching,"
as Gray said of him, "the very heartstrings
of compassion with so masterly a hand
as to merit a place among the greatest of
poets." His humour is often delightful, and his
pictures of contemporary life, such as his <i>London
Lickpenny</i> and his <i>Prologue to the Storie of
Thebes</i>, are as vivid as Chaucer's. In versatility
he has no rival among his predecessors and
contemporaries. Gray notices that, at times,
he approaches sublimity. His style often is
beautiful,—fluent, copious, and at its best eminently
musical. The influence which he exercised
on subsequent English and Scotch
literature would alone entitle him to a prominent
position in any history of English poetry.
But the handbooks think otherwise, and he
occupies just three pages in M. Jusserand's
work, the only estimate of his work being
confined to the assertion that "he was a worthy
man if ever there was one, industrious and
prolific," etc., and the only criticism is the remark
that his "prosody was rather lax." And
this is how poor Lydgate fares at our historian's
hands. To Hoccleve are assigned just
one page and a few lines. Hardyng figures only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200" href="#Page_200">[200]</a></span>
in the bibliography at the bottom of a page.
The ballads are despatched in fifteen lines.
Hawes' <i>Pastime of Pleasure</i>, memorable alike
both for the preciseness with which it marks the
transition from the poetry of mediævalism to
that of the Renaissance, for its probable influence
on Spenser, and for its intrinsic charm, its
pathos, its picturesqueness, and its sweet and
plaintive music, is curtly dismissed, as the handbooks
dismiss it, as "an allegory of unendurable
dulness." If M. Jusserand would throw aside
the manuals and turn to the original, he would
probably see reason to modify his verdict. Our
author's breathless gallop through the Scotch
poets, to whom he allots nine pages, can only
be regarded with silent astonishment by readers
who happen to known anything about those
most remarkable men. Huchown is not so
much as mentioned. The amazing nonsense
which he writes in summing up Dunbar, we
will transcribe, <i>ut ex uno discas omnia</i>:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Dunbar, with never-flagging spirit, attempts every style....
His flowers are too flowery, his odours too fragrant;
by moments it is no longer a delight, but almost a pain. It
is not sufficient that his birds should sing; they must sing
among perfumes, and these perfumes are coloured."</p></blockquote>

<p>Has M. Jusserand ever read <i>The Dance of the
Seven Deadly Sins</i>, <i>The Twa Maryit Wemen and
the Wedo</i>, and the minor poems of Dunbar? If
he has, would he pronounce that these "flowers"
are "too flowery"—these "odours" "too fragrant,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201" href="#Page_201">[201]</a></span>
or would he feel the absurdity of generalizing
on ludicrously insufficient knowledge? His
verdicts on the other Scotch poets are marked
by the same superficiality, and we regret to add
flippancy. To class Henryson among poets
whose style is "florid" and whose roses are
"splendid but too full-blown" is to show that
M. Jusserand knows as little about him as he
seems to know about Dunbar. In all Henryson's
poems there are only three short passages
which could by any possibility be described as
florid. The prose of the fifteenth century fares
even worse at his hands. Capgrave is mentioned
only in the bibliography! Of the interest
and importance of Pecock, historically
and intrinsically, he appears to have no conception;
on the real significance of the <i>Repressor</i>
he never even touches, and how indeed could
he in the less than one page which is assigned
to one of the most remarkable writers in the
fifteenth century? A page suffices for the <i>Paston
Letters</i>, and four lines for Malory's <i>Morte
d'Arthur</i>!</p>

<p>Now we would ask M. Jusserand, in all seriousness,
what possible end can be served by a book
of this kind, except the encouragement of everything
that is detestable to the real scholar:
superficiality, want of thoroughness, and false
assumption, and what is more, the public dissemination
of error, and of crude and misleading
judgments. Such a work as the present, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202" href="#Page_202">[202]</a></span>
soundness and trustworthiness of which ninety-nine
readers in every hundred must necessarily
take for granted, can only be justified when it
proceeds from one who is a master of his immense
subject, from one whose generalizations
are based on amply sufficient knowledge, whose
suppressions and omissions spring neither from
carelessness nor from ignorance, but from discrimination,
and in whose statements and judgments
implicit reliance can be placed. To none
of these qualifications has M. Jusserand the
smallest pretension.</p>

<p>We have no wish to seem discourteous to M.
Jusserand or to say anything which can cause
him annoyance, but it is no more than simple
duty in any critic with a becoming sense of
responsibility to discountenance in every way
the production of such books as these. They
are not only mischievous in themselves, but they
form precedents for books which are more mischievous
still. We like M. Jusserand's enthusiasm,
but we would exhort him to reduce the
flatulent dimensions, which his ambition has
here so unhappily assumed, to that more tempered
ambition which gave us the monographs
on Piers Ploughman and on the Tudor novelists.</p>

Thomas De Quincey and his Friends and Associates.</i>
Written and collected by James Hogg.</p></div>


<p>To a thoughtful reader there is, perhaps,
no sadder spectacle than those sixteen
volumes which represent all that remains to
us of Thomas De Quincey. What superb
powers, what noble and manifold gifts, what
capacity for invaluable and imperishable achievements
had Nature lavished on this extraordinary
man! Metaphysics might for all time
have been a debtor to that vigorous, acute,
and subtle intellect, at once so speculative and
logical, so inquisitive and discriminating. Æsthetic
criticism might have found in him a
second Lessing, and literary criticism a superior
Sainte-Beuve. For, in addition to all that would
have enabled him to excel in abstract thought,
he had—and in ample measure—the qualities
which make men consummate critics: rare power
of analysis, the nicest perception, sensibility,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204" href="#Page_204">[204]</a></span>
sympathy, good taste, good sense, immense
erudition. He might have contributed masterpieces
to Theology, to History, to Economic
Science. But they know not his name. He has
set his seal on nothing but on English style.
About a hundred and fifty articles contributed
to magazines and encyclopædias, some of them
of a high order of literary merit, many of them
simply worthless, the majority of them containing
what is inferior so disproportionately in
excess of what is valuable that they may be
likened to dustbins, with jewels here and there
glittering among the rubbish;—this is what represents
him. It is as a master of style, by virtue
of what he accomplished as a rhetorician and
prose poet only, that he will live. But this, comparatively
scanty as it is, is of pre-eminent, of
unique value, and will suffice to secure him a
place for ever among the classics of English prose.
He has also another claim, if not to our reverence,
at least to our curious attention and interest,—and
that attention and interest he can
scarcely fail to excite in every generation,—his
autobiographical writings give us a picture, and
that with fascinating power, of one of the most
extraordinary personalities on record.</p>

<p>Indiscriminating admiration is among the most
pleasing traits of youth, but in men of mature
years it loses its attractiveness. When it is no
longer the effervescence of juvenile enthusiasm
for which all make allowance, it becomes, like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205" href="#Page_205">[205]</a></span>
the levities of boyhood affected in middle life,
merely vapid folly. In relation to its object it
not only defeats its own ends, but is apt to make
recipient and donor alike ridiculous. Nor is this
all. By some curious law of association which
we cannot pretend to explain, its almost inevitable
ally is dulness, and dulness of a peculiarly
wearisome and exasperating kind. During the
last few years these peculiarities have become so
alarmingly epidemic that it really seems high
time to form, on the principle of Mr. Morris's
Society for the Preservation of Ancient Monuments,
a Society for the Preservation of Literary
Reputations. When those "of whom to be dispraised
were no small praise" take to eulogy and
editing, an unhappy Classic may well look to his
true friends. It is nothing less than appalling to
behold the mountains of rubbish now gradually
accumulating over the work—the real work—of
such poets as Wordsworth, Shelley, and Keats;
rubbish of their own, rescued with cruel industry
from the oblivion to which they would themselves
have consigned it, rubbish of their commentators
and editors, dulness and inanity unutterable.
"What, sir," asked an Eton boy of
Foote, "was the best thing you ever said?"
"Well," was the reply, "I once saw a chimney-sweep
on a high prancing, high-mettled horse.
'There,' said I, 'goes <a name="Correct11" id="Correct11">Warburton on Shakespeare.'"</a>
But it is not in the Warburtons, not in the
chimney-sweepers, that the mischief lies; it is in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206" href="#Page_206">[206]</a></span>
those who may be called the scavengers and
sextons of literature, in those who, utterly unable
to discern between what is precious and
what is worthless in a man's work, thrust all,
without distinction, into prominence, and thus
not only enable an author to "write himself
down," but, by their indiscriminating eulogies,
assist him in his suicide. The subtlest form,
indeed, which detraction can assume is over-praise,
for a man is thus forced to give the lie to
his own reputation.</p>

<p>No one, perhaps, has suffered so much from
ill-judging admirers as De Quincey. If ever an
author needed a judicious adviser, when preparing
his works for publication in a permanent
form, and a judicious editor, when the time had
come for that final edition on which his title to
future fame should rest, it was the English
opium-eater. But, unhappily, he had no such
adviser in his lifetime, and he has had no such
editor since. He consequently reprinted much
which ought never to have been reprinted at all,
and he omitted to reprint some things which
would have done honour to him. His besetting
faults, even in his vigour, were loquacity and
silliness, a habit of "drawing out the thread of
his verbosity finer than the staple of his argument"—a
tendency to peddle and dawdle, as well
as to indulge in a sort of pleasantry, so attenuated
as to border closely on inanity. As he
grew older these habits became more confirmed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207" href="#Page_207">[207]</a></span>
His puerility and garrulousness in his later writings
are often intolerable. But this was not the
worst. In revising some of his earlier papers,
and particularly the <i>Confessions</i>, he not only
imported into them tiresome irrelevancies and
superfluities, but, in emending, ruined the glorious
passages on which his fame as a rhetorician
and prose poet rests; such has been the fate,
among others, of the exquisite description of the
powers of opium,—the superb passage beginning,
"The town of L.. represented the earth with
its sorrows and its graves,"<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> and of the dreams in
the second part of the <i>Confessions</i>, particularly
of the sublime one beginning, "The dream commenced
with a music."<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>Mr. James Hogg tells us that his design in
publishing the present volume was that he
might "place a stone upon the cairn of the
man" who had treated him "with an almost
paternal tenderness." We sincerely sympathize
with Mr. Hogg's pious intention, but we submit
that the truest kindness which he, or any other
admirer of De Quincey could do him, would be
not to augment but to lighten the cairn which
indiscreet admirers are so industriously piling
over him. To change the figure, the best service
which could be rendered to De Quincey would
be to relieve him of his superfluous baggage, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208" href="#Page_208">[208]</a></span>
to add to it. His fame would stand much higher,
if his sixteen volumes were vigorously weeded;
if the sweepings and refuse of his study, so injudiciously
given to the world by Dr. Japp and
Mr. Hogg, were given instead to the flames; and
if reminiscents and biographers would only leave
him to tell, in his own fashion, his own story,
especially as it is one of those stories the interest
of which depends purely on the telling. We
have already expressed our sympathy with Mr.
Hogg's pious intention. It only remains for us
to express our regret that Mr. Hogg's piety
should have taken the form of the most barefaced
piece of book-making which we ever remember
to have met with. Addison, if we are
not mistaken, somewhere describes a man to
whom a single volume afforded all the amusement
and variety of a whole library, for, by the
time he had arrived at the middle, he had completely
forgotten the beginning, and when he
arrived at the end, he had completely forgotten
the whole. Mr. Hogg appears to proceed on the
assumption that it is pretty much the same with
the public and its memory, that its capacity for
amusement is permanent, but that its recollection
of what has amused it is so treacherous, that
repetition will be sure to have all the attraction
of novelty. This is, no doubt, unhappily true.
But it is a truth which no critic has a right to
concede.</p>

<p>All that is of interest in this volume is little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209" href="#Page_209">[209]</a></span>
more than the literal reproduction, in another
shape, of material embodied in a Life of De
Quincey, published by Dr. Alexander Japp, under
the pseudonym of H. A. Page, in 1877. Its exact
composition is as follows. Eliminating the preface
and the index, the book consists of 359
pages. Of these, seventy consist of a dreary
<i>réchauffé</i> by Dr. Japp himself of his own Life of
De Quincey, and of the additional information
contained in his edition of the Posthumous
Works. Next comes a series of reminiscences,
extracted from Dr. Japp's Life, from Dr. Garnett's
edition of the <i>Confessions</i>, from the <i>Quarterly
Review</i>, and from other sources all equally
accessible. Then Mr. Hogg himself opens fire
with <i>Days and Nights with De Quincey</i>. An
essay—"On the supposed Scriptural Expression
for Eternity"—excellently illustrating De Quincey
in his senility, is reprinted, with awe-struck
admiration, from the American edition of his
works.</p>

<p>For the purpose, presumably, of adding to the
bulk of the book, Moir's ballad, <i>De Quincey's
Revenge</i>, is included, though its sole connection
with De Quincey is, that it deals with a
legend concerning the possible ancestors of a
possible branch of his possible family. Then we
have one of Mr. Shadworth Hodgson LL.D.'s
<i>Outcast Essays</i>, "On the genius of De Quincey,"
the reason for the hospitable entertainment of
the outcast being by no means apparent. Among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210" href="#Page_210">[210]</a></span>
other dreary trifles is a reprint of a Latin theme,
one of De Quincey's college exercises. As Mr.
Hogg has chosen to reprint and translate this, it
would have been as well to print and translate
it correctly. "Quæ ansibus obstant" should, of
course, have been "ausibus," and "oculi perstringuntur"
cannot possibly mean "are spellbound,"
but "are dazzled."</p>

<p>The republication of these pieces was, we
repeat, a great mistake, another lamentable illustration
of the cruel wrong which officious
and ill-judging admirers may inflict on a writer's
reputation. Talleyrand once observed that, a
wise man would be safer with a foolish than
with a clever wife, for a foolish wife could
only compromise herself, but a clever wife
might compromise her husband. Substituting
'unambitious' for 'foolish' and 'ambitious' for
'clever,' we are very much inclined to apply
the same remark to a great writer and his
friends. It requires a Johnson to support a
Boswell, and a Goethe to support an Eckermann.</p>

<i>A Life of Shakespeare.</i> By Sidney Lee.</p></div>


<p>It is a pleasure to turn from the slovenly and
perfunctory work, from the plausible charlatanry
and pretentious incompetence which it has
so often been our unwelcome duty to expose in
these columns, to such a volume as the volume
before us. It is books like these which retrieve
the honour of English scholarship. A wide
range of general knowledge, immense special
knowledge, scrupulous accuracy, both in the
investigation and presentation of facts, the
sound judgment, the tact, the insight which in
labyrinths of chaotic traditions and conflicting
testimony can discern the clue to probability and
truth—these are the qualifications indispensable
to a successful biographer of Shakespeare. And
these are the qualifications which Mr. Lee possesses,
in larger measure than have been possessed
by any one who has essayed the task
which he has here undertaken. A ranker and
more tangled jungle than that presented by the
traditions, the apocrypha, the theories, the conjectures
which have gradually accumulated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212" href="#Page_212">[212]</a></span>
round the memory of Shakespeare since the
time of Rowe, could scarcely be conceived. In
this jungle some, like Charles Knight, have
altogether lost themselves; others, like Joseph
Hunter, have struck out vigorously into wrong
tracks, and floundered into quagmires. Halliwell
Phillipps, sure-footed and wary though he was,
certainly had not the clue to it. But Mr. Lee,
who can plainly say with Comus,—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"I know each lane, and <a name="Correct12" id="Correct12">every alley green,</a></div>
<div class="i0">Dingle or bushy dell of this wild wood,</div>
<div class="i0">And every bosky bourne from side to side,</div>
<div class="i0">My daily walks and ancient neighbourhood,"</div></div></div>

<p>has thridded it, and taught others to thrid
it, as no one else has done. And he will
have his reward. He has produced what deserves
to be, and what will probably become,
the standard life of our great national poet.</p>

<p>Mr. Lee's book is substantially a reproduction
of his article on Shakespeare, contributed to the
<i>Dictionary of National Biography</i>, the high
merits of which have long been recognised by
scholars; and he has certainly done well to
make that article popularly accessible by reprinting
it in a separate form. But the present
volume is not a mere reproduction of his contribution
to the Dictionary; it is much more.
He has here filled out what he could there
sketch only in outline; what he could there
state only as results and conclusions, he here
illustrates and justifies by corroboration and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213" href="#Page_213">[213]</a></span>
proof. He has, moreover, both in the text and
in the appendices, brought together a great
mass of interesting and pertinent collateral
matter which the scope of the Dictionary necessarily
precluded.</p>

<p>More than a century ago George Steevens
wrote: "All that can be known with any degree
of certainty about Shakespeare is that he was
born at Stratford-on-Avon, married and had
children there, went to London, where he commenced
actor, wrote poems and plays, returned
to Stratford, made his will, died, and was buried
there." And, if we set aside probable inferences,
this is all we do know of any importance about
his life. His pedigree cannot certainly be traced
beyond his father. Nothing is known of the
place of his education—that he was educated at
the Stratford Grammar School is pure assumption.
His life between his birth and the publication
of <i>Venus and Adonis</i> in 1593, is an
absolute blank. It is at least doubtful whether
the supposed allusion to him in Greene's <i>Groat's
Worth of Wit</i>, and in Chettle's <i>Kind Heart's
Dream</i> have any reference to him at all; it is
still more doubtful whether the William Shakespeare
of Adrian Quiney's letter, or of the Rogers
and Addenbroke summonses, or the William
Shakespeare who was assessed for property in
St. Helens, Bishopsgate, was the poet. We
know practically nothing of his life in London,
or of the date of his arrival in London; we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214" href="#Page_214">[214]</a></span>
ignorant of the date of his return to Stratford,
of his happiness or unhappiness in married life,
of his habits, of his last days, of the cause of his
death. Not a sentence that fell from his lips
has been authentically recorded. At least one-half
of the alleged facts of his biography is as
purely apocryphal as the life of Homer attributed
to Herodotus.</p>

<p>But probability, as Bishop Butler says, is the
guide of life, and on the basis of probability
may be raised, it must be owned, a fairly satisfactory
biography. Mr. Lee has not been able
to contribute any new facts to Shakespeare's
life, which is certainly not his fault; but he
has given us a recapitulation, as lucid as it is
exhaustive, of all that the industry of successive
generations of memorialists from Ben Jonson
to Halliwell Phillipps has succeeded in accumulating,
and he has been as judicious in what
he has rejected as in what he has adopted.
From the curse of the typical Shakespearian
biographer—we mean the statement of mere inference
and hypothesis as fact—he is absolutely
free. He has done excellent service in giving,
if not finishing, at least swashing blows to the
monstrous fictions of the theorists on the sonnets,
particularly to the Fitton-Pembroke mare's nest,
fictions which have been gradually generating a
Shakespeare, as purely apocryphal as the Roland
of the song or the Apollonius of Philostratus.</p>

<p>Mr. Lee's most remarkable contribution to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215" href="#Page_215">[215]</a></span>
speculative Shakespearian criticism, in which,
we are glad to say, he does not often indulge, is
his contention that the W. H. of the dedication
to the sonnets was William Hall, a small piratical
stationer. It is never wise to speak positively
on what must necessarily be, till certain
evidence is obtainable, a matter of speculation.
But we are very much inclined to think that Mr.
Lee's contention has at least something in its
favour. Our readers will remember that one of
the chief points in the enigma of the sonnets is
the dedication, and it runs thus: "To the onlie
begetter of these ensuing Sonnets, Mr. W. H., all
happiness and that eternitie promised by our
ever-living poet wisheth the well-wishing adventurer
in setting forth. T. T." It has generally
been assumed that the "W. H." is the youth who
is the hero of the first group of sonnets, and the
poet's friend, and he has commonly been identified
either with William Herbert, third Earl of
Pembroke, or with Henry Wriothesley, third Earl
of Southampton. The difficulties in the way of
either hypothesis—and on each hypothesis not
Babels merely, but cities of Babels have been
raised—are to an unprejudiced mind insurmountable.
Mr. Lee maintains with plausible
ingenuity, but not, we think, conclusively, that
there is no proof that the youth of the sonnets
was named "Will" at all. His analysis of the
"Will" sonnets is a masterpiece of subtle ingenuity,
and well deserves careful attention.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216" href="#Page_216">[216]</a></span>
He then proceeds to adopt the theory that the
word "begetter" is not to be taken in the sense
of "inspirer," but simply as "procurer" or
"obtainer" of the sonnets for T. T., <i>i.e.</i>, the
publisher, Thomas Thorpe. In other words, that
Thorpe dedicated the sonnets to W. H., in return
for W. H. having piratically obtained them for
him. This is at least doubtful. In the first
place it may reasonably be questioned whether
"begetter" could have the meaning which is here
assigned to it; the passages quoted from <i>Hamlet</i>
("acquire and beget a temperance") and from
Dekker's <i>Satiro-mastix</i>, "I have some cousins
german at Court shall beget you the reversion
of the Master of the King's Revels," are anything
but conclusive. Still, Thorpe, who is by no
means remarkable for the purity of his English,
may have used it in the sense which Mr. Lee's
theory requires.</p>

<p>Shakespeare's sonnets, as is well known,
were circulating among his friends in manuscript,
and Mr. Lee has discovered that one
William Hall was well known as an Autolycus
among publishers, and had already edited, under
the initials W. H., a collection of poems left
by the Jesuit poet, Southwell—in other words
had already done for the publisher, George Eld,
what it is assumed that he now did for Thomas
Thorpe. Mr. Lee's theory is, it must be admitted,
plausible, and few would hesitate to pronounce
it far more probable than the theory which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217" href="#Page_217">[217]</a></span>
would identify the enigmatical initials with
the names of Pembroke or Southampton.</p>

<p>The chapters dealing with the sonnets are, in
our opinion the most valuable contribution which
has ever been made to this important province
of Shakespearian study, and it may be said of
Mr. Lee, as Porson said of Bentley, that we may
learn more from him when he is wrong than
from many others when they are right. His
contention is, and it is supported with exhaustive
erudition, that these poems are, in the main,
a concession to the fashion, then so much in
vogue, of sonnet writing; that their themes are
the conventional themes treated in those compositions;
that some of them were dedicated to
Southampton, that some may be autobiographical,
but that they are wholly miscellaneous,
and tell no consecutive story, as so many critics
have erroneously assumed. We cannot accept
all Mr. Lee's theories and conclusions, but one
thing is certain, that they are supported with
infinitely more skill and learning than any other
theories which have been broached on this hopelessly
baffling problem.</p>

<p>We will conclude by noticing what seem to us
slight blemishes in this admirable work. There
is nothing to warrant the assertion on p. 158 that
most of Shakespeare's sonnets were produced in
1594, which is to cut the knot of a most difficult
question. Indeed, with respect to the whole
question of the sonnets, Mr. Lee is, we venture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218" href="#Page_218">[218]</a></span>
to submit, a little too dogmatic. It is a question
which no one can settle as positively as Mr. Lee
seems to settle it. There is surely no good, or even
plausible reason for doubting the authenticity of
<i>Titus Andronicus</i>, whatever innumerable Shakespearian
critics may say, external and internal
evidence alike being almost conclusive for its
genuineness. There is nothing to warrant the
supposition that Shakespeare was on bad terms
with his wife. The famous bequest in his Will
was probably a delicate compliment, and we are
surprised that Mr. Lee should not have noticed
this. Among the testimonies to Shakespeare
in the seventeenth century, Mr. Lee should
have recorded that of Archbishop Sharp, who,
according to Speaker Onslow, used to say "that
the Bible and Shakespeare had made him Archbishop
of York."</p>

<p>Mr. Lee must also forgive us for adding that,
in this work at least, æsthetic criticism is not
his strong point, and he would have done well
to keep it within even narrower bounds than he
has done. Many of those who would be the first
to admire his erudition and the other scholarly
qualities which are so conspicuous in every
chapter of his book, will, we fear, take exception
to much of his criticism, especially in relation to
the sonnets. It is too positive; it is unsympathetic;
it is too mechanical. But our debt to Mr.
Lee is so great, that we feel almost ashamed to
make any deductions in our tribute of gratitude.</p>

<p>There goes a story that an ingenuous youth,
who had the privilege of an introduction
to Lord Beaconsfield, resolved to make the best of
the occasion, by extracting, if possible, from that
astute political sage the secret of success in life.
It might take the form, he thought, of a little
practical advice. For that advice, explaining
the object with which it was asked, he accordingly
applied. "Yes," said Lord Beaconsfield,
"I think I can give you some advice which may
possibly be of use to you. Never trouble yourself
about The Man in the Iron Mask, and never
get into a discussion about the authorship of the
Letters of Junius." In all seriousness we think
it is high time that the "closure" should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220" href="#Page_220">[220]</a></span>
applied to a debate on another "mystery" of
which every one must be tired to death, except
perhaps those who contribute to it. If some progress
could be made towards the solution of the
Mystery of Shakespeare's Sonnets, if there was
the faintest indication of any dawn on the darkness,
even the wearied reviewer would be patient.
But the thing remains exactly where it was,
before this appalling literary epidemic set in.
During the last three or four years scarcely a
month has passed without its "monograph,"
many of these treatises, mere replicas of their
predecessors, differing only in degrees of stupidity
and uselessness. Mr. Cuming Walters' volume,
sensible enough and intelligent, we quite concede,
simply thrashes the straw. It professes to
be an original contribution to the question. There
is not a view or theory in it, which is not now
a platitude to every one who has had the patience
to follow this controversy. It analyses the
Sonnets; they have been analysed hundreds of
times. It asks who was W. H.; it answers the
question as it has been answered <i>usque ad
nauseam</i>. It discusses the dark lady, and lands
us in the same shifting quagmire of opinion in
which Mr. Tyler and his coadjutors and opponents
have been floundering for the last four years.
It assumes, it rejects, it questions, it suggests,
what has been assumed, rejected, questioned,
and suggested over and over again. Indeed, it
may now be said with literal truth that, unless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221" href="#Page_221">[221]</a></span>
some fresh discovery is made, nothing new,
whether in the way of absurdity or sense, can
be advanced on this subject. But books are
multiplied with such rapidity and in such prodigious
numbers in these days, that they thrive,
like cannibals, on one another. The last comer
is simply its forgotten predecessor in disguise.</p>

<p>But platitude is the very last charge that can
be brought against Mr. Jesse Johnson's contribution
to the curiosities of Shakespearian criticism.
The theory advanced here is, that Shakespeare
never wrote the Sonnets at all, that he was quite
unequal to their composition, that the author of
them "was probably fifty, perhaps sixty, and
that he was besides a man of genius, which
Shakespeare certainly was not. I would not,"
says Mr. Jesse Johnson, "deny to Shakespeare
great talent. His success in and with theatres
certainly forbids us to do so. That he had a
bent or a talent for rhyming or for poetry, an
early and persistent tradition and the inscription
over his grave indicate. And otherwise
there could hardly have been attributed to him
so many plays, besides those written by the
author of the Sonnets." Shakespeare may have
been equal to trifles like <i>Hamlet</i> or <i>Lear</i>—for
Mr. Jesse Johnson would be the last to dispute
the claim made for Shakespeare as a hard-working
playwright clearing his twenty-five
thousand dollars a year (Mr. Jesse Johnson is
calculating his income according to the present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222" href="#Page_222">[222]</a></span>
time)—but "to Shakespeare working as an actor,
adapter or perhaps author came a very great
poet, one who outclassed all the writers of that
day, and it is the poetry of that great unknown
which, flowing into Shakespeare's work, comprises
all or nearly all of it which the world treasures
or cares to remember." If we told Mr. Jesse
Johnson, and all who resemble Mr. Jesse Johnson,
the truth about their productions, we are quite
certain of one thing—but the one thing of which
we are certain it would, perhaps, be good taste in
us to leave unsaid.</p>

<p>Of a very different order is Mr. Samuel
Butler's <i>Shakespeare's Sonnets Reconsidered</i>.
This is the work of a scholar, but of a scholar
mounted on a hobby-horse of unusually vigorous
mettle. Mr. Butler begins with a tremendous
onslaught on the theories of the Southamptonites,
the Herbertists and the anti-autobiographical
party; and in this part of his work he has certainly
much to say which is both pertinent and plausible,
nay, in our opinion, convincing. But he is
less successful in construction than in demolition.
His own contention is, that the Sonnets are
undoubtedly autobiographical, and very derogatory
to Shakespeare's moral character. He is
satisfied that "Mr. W. H." was the youth who
inspired them, not the youth who simply
collected, or procured them, and gave them to
Thorpe, but that this youth was neither the
Earl of Southampton nor the Earl of Pembroke,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223" href="#Page_223">[223]</a></span>
nor, indeed, any one of superior social rank to
the poet, though this has always been assumed.
Adopting the theory of Tyrwhitt and Malone
that the key to the youth's name is to be found
in the seventh line of the twentieth sonnet,—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"A man in hew all <i>Hewes</i> in his controlling."</div></div></div>

<p>and deducing, with them, from Sonnets cxxxv.,
cxxxvi. and cxliii. that the youth's Christian
name was William, Mr. Butler believes, as they
did, that the youth's name was William Hughes,
or Hewes; and Mr. Butler is inclined to identify
him, though he speaks, of course, by no means
confidently, with a William Hughes, who served
as steward in the <i>Vanguard</i>, <i>Swiftsure</i> and
<i>Dreadnought</i>, and who died in March, 1636-7.
Mr. Butler supports his theories with hypotheses
which an impartial judge of evidence will find
it difficult to concede. In the face of Sonnets
xxxvi., xxxvii. and cxxiv. the contention that
the youth was not in a superior social station to
the poet cannot be maintained with any confidence.
There are still graver difficulties in the
way of supposing that the Sonnets were written
between January, 1585-6 and December, 1588.
That they could be the work of a young man
between his twenty-first and his twenty-fourth
year, and have preceded by some four years
the composition of <i>Venus and Adonis</i> and the
<i>Rape of Lucrece</i>, is simply incredible; but it is a
question which cannot be argued, for we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224" href="#Page_224">[224]</a></span>
nothing but mere hypothesis to go upon. Mr.
Butler's arrangement and interpretation of the
Sonnets are, moreover, purely fanciful. When
Mr. Butler would have us believe that some of
the Sonnets in the second group, from cxxvii.
to clii., are addressed to and concern not the
woman, but the youth, he asks us to accept a
theory which is not only revolting, but which
sets all probability at defiance. Similarly absurd,
he must forgive us for saying, is his grotesquely
repulsive interpretation of Sonnet xxxiv. Nor
is there anything to justify the interpretation
placed on Sonnets xxxiii. and xxxiv. or the collocation
of cxxi. All that can be said for Mr.
Butler's exceedingly ingenious and admirably
argued theory is, that it supports a view of the
question which, if it admits of no positive confutation,
produces no conviction. No theory,
based on an arbitrary arrangement of these
poems and on positive deductions drawn, or
rather strained, from most ambiguous evidence
and from pure hypotheses, can possibly be satisfactory.</p>

<p>The problem presented in these Sonnets is
undoubtedly the most fascinating problem in
all literature, and it is as exasperating as it
is fascinating. It appears to be so simple, it
seems constantly to be on the verge of its
solution, and yet the moment we get beyond a
certain point in inquiry, the more complex its
apparent simplicity is discovered to be, the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225" href="#Page_225">[225]</a></span>
hopeless all prospect of explaining the enigma.
Take the difficulty of assuming, what seems
to be obvious, that they are autobiographical.
Here we have the poet, and that poet Shakespeare,
admitting the world into the innermost
secrets of his life, taking his contemporaries,
without the least reserve, into his confidence,
inviting and assisting them to the study of his
own morbid anatomy, and, in a word, stripping
himself bare with all the shameless abandon of
Jean Jacques and of Casanova. Everything
that we know of Shakespeare seems to discountenance
the probability of his having any
such intention. No anecdote, with the smallest
pretence to authenticity, couples his name with
scandal. The theory which identifies him with
the W. S. of Willobie's <i>Avisa</i> has no real basis
to rest on, and without corroboration is
absolutely inadmissible as evidence. Whatever
Shakespeare's private life may have been, it
is quite clear that he carefully regarded the
decencies, and would have been the last man in
the world to pose publicly in the character presented
to us in the Sonnets. If the poems are
autobiographical, we can only conclude that
they were published without his consent, and
even to his great annoyance. This may certainly
have been the case, and is indeed often
assumed to have been so. But even then it
is, to say the least, curious, that there should
have been no tradition about the extraordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226" href="#Page_226">[226]</a></span>
story which they tell, especially considering the
distinction of the <i>dramatis personæ</i>. Assuming
that the youth, who is their hero, was a real
person, he must, judging from Sonnets xxxvi.,
xxxvii. and cxxiv., have been conspicuous in the
society of that time; assuming the rival poet to
be a real person, he must have been equally conspicuous
in another sphere, while Shakespeare
himself, at the time the Sonnets were published,
was the most distinguished poet and playwright
in London. It is, therefore, extraordinary that
all traces of an affair in which persons of so
much eminence were involved, and which would
have furnished scandal-mongers with the topics
in which such gossips most delight, should have
entirely disappeared. We must either conclude
that posterity has been very unfortunate in the
loss of records which would have thrown light
on the matter, or that Shakespeare's contemporaries
knew nothing of the facts, and contented
themselves with the poetry; or, lastly, that
what we may call the fable of the Sonnets, the
drama in which W. H., "the dark lady," and the
rival poet play their parts, is as fictitious as the
plot of <i>The Midsummer Night's Dream</i> or <i>The
Tempest</i>.</p>

<p>It is not our intention to support any of the
numerous theories which pretend to give us the
key to these Sonnets, still less to propose any
new one, but simply to show that the enigma
presented by them is as insoluble as ever, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227" href="#Page_227">[227]</a></span>
that all attempts to throw light on it have
served to effect nothing more than to make
darkness visible and confusion worse confounded.
Let us briefly review the facts. In 1609, Thomas
Thorpe, a well-known Elizabethan bookseller,
published a small quarto volume, entitled <i>Shakespeare's
Sonnets</i>, having apparently not obtained
them from the poet himself, and to this volume
was prefixed the following dedication:—"To
the onlie begetter of these ensuing Sonnets, Mr.
W. H., all happiness and that eternitie promised
by our ever-living poet wisheth the well-wishing
adventurer in setting forth. T. T." Here begins
and ends all that is certainly known about
W. H. and his relation to these poems. No one
knows who he was; no one knows what is
exactly meant by the word "begetter," whether
it is to be taken in the sense of inspirer, whether
that is to say W. H. is the youth celebrated
in the Sonnets—"the master-mistress" of the
poet's passion, or whether it simply means the
person who got or procured the poems for
Thorpe,—in which case the identification of the
initials is of no consequence, unless we are
to suppose that the youth who inspired them
presented them to Thorpe. Mr. Sidney Lee, in
his very able paper in the <i>Fortnightly Review</i> for
February, 1898, and in his Life of Shakespeare,
argues that there is no proof that the youth
of the Sonnets was named "Will," though
this has always been assumed to be the case.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228" href="#Page_228">[228]</a></span>
The evidence on which the point must be
argued will be found in the puns on "Will"
in Sonnets cxxxiv.-vi. and cxliii. It seems to
us, we must own, that the balance of probability,
though not certainly in favour of the
affirmative, decidedly inclines towards it.
Granting then,—for it is, after all, only an
hypothesis,—that the initials W. H. are those of
the youth celebrated in the Sonnets, to whom
are they to be assigned? The youth, whoever he
was, is represented as being in a social position
superior to that of the poet; he has apparently
rank and title; he has wealth; he is young and
eminently handsome, his beauty being of a
delicate, effeminate cast; he is highly cultivated
and accomplished; he is on terms of the closest
intimacy with the poet, by whom he is passionately
beloved; he lives a free, loose life, and he
intrigues with his friend's mistress.</p>

<p>Passing by all preposterous theories about
William Harte, William Hughes, William Himself
and the like, we come to the two names
which seem worth serious consideration, William
Herbert, third Earl of Pembroke, and Henry
Wriothesly, third Earl of Southampton. The
Pembroke theory, with Mr. Thomas Tyler's
corollary identifying the "dark lady" with
Mary Fitton, has been adopted by Dr. Brandes
in his work on Shakespeare just published. But
the difficulties in the way of accepting it are
insuperable. They have been admirably discussed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229" href="#Page_229">[229]</a></span>
by Mr. Sidney Lee in the article to which
we have referred. In the first place, while
Shakespeare must have been on terms of more
than brotherly intimacy with the youth of the
Sonnets, there is no evidence at all that he had
ever been in any other relation with the Earl
than in the ordinary one of servant and patron.
The words of Heminge and Condell, in the dedication
of the first folio to Pembroke and his
brother, merely state that they had both of
them "prosequted" him with favour; in other
words, been to him what they had been to
many other dramatists and men of letters; and
that is the only evidence of any connection
between Shakespeare and Pembroke. Tradition
was certainly silent about any relations between
them, for Aubrey, as Mr. Lee has pointed out,
though he has collected much information about
both, says nothing about their acquaintanceship,
though he mentions Pembroke's connection
with Massinger, and Southampton's with
Shakespeare. But Thorpe's dedication is conclusive
against Pembroke. In 1609, Pembroke,
who had succeeded to the title on the death of
his father in January, 1601, was Lord Chamberlain,
a Knight of the Garter, and one of the
most distinguished noblemen in England. Is
it credible that Thorpe would address him as
Mr. W. H., more especially as in the other
works which he inscribed to him,—and he
inscribed several,—he is careful to give him all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230" href="#Page_230">[230]</a></span>
his titles, and to address him with the most
fulsome servility? Again, Pembroke, as Mr.
Lee points out, was never a "Mister" at all. As
the eldest son of an earl, he was designated by
courtesy Lord Herbert, and as Lord Herbert he
is always spoken of in contemporary records.
The appellation "Mr." was not, as Mr. Lee
observes, used loosely, as it is now, and could
never have been applied to any nobleman,
whether holding his title by right or by courtesy.
Whatever allowance may be made for a poet's
passion and fancy, some weight must be attached
to the insistence made in the Sonnets on the
youth's delicate and effeminate beauty. It is
true that we have no portraits of Pembroke
before he arrived at middle age, but those
portraits justify us in concluding that he
could never, at any time, have been distinguished
by beauty of the type indicated in the
poems.</p>

<p>Against all this the advocates of the Pembroke
theory have nothing to place but conjectures, a
series of insignificant coincidences and the
assumption that the woman in the Sonnets is to
be identified with the woman who bore Herbert
a child, Mary Fitton. The publication of Sonnet
xliv. by Jaggard, in 1599, shows that the intrigue
between the youth and the dark lady, which is
the central event of the Sonnets, was already,
and had probably been for some time, in full
career, while there is no evidence that Pembroke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231" href="#Page_231">[231]</a></span>
was involved with Mary Fitton before
the summer of 1600. But what finally disposes
of this theory is the testimony afforded by
Lady Newdigate-Newdegate's recently published
<i>Gossip from a Muniment Room</i>. Indispensable
requisites in the lady of the Sonnets are,
that she should be dark, a "black beauty" with
"eyes raven black," with hair which resembles
"black wires," and that she should be a married
woman; but the portraits—and there are two of
them—of Mary Fitton, show that she had a fair
complexion, with brown hair and grey eyes; and
she remained unmarried, until long after her
connection with Pembroke had ceased.</p>

<p>The theory which identifies W. H. with the
Earl of Southampton is slightly more plausible,
but the difficulties in the way of accepting it are,
in truth, equally insuperable. This theory has
at least one great point in its favour. Shakespeare
was acquainted, and it may be inferred
intimately acquainted, with Southampton, as
the dedications of <i>Venus and Adonis</i> and the
<i>Rape of Lucrece</i> indicate. Of his affection and
respect for this nobleman he has left an expression
almost as remarkable as the language of the
sonnets. "The love I dedicate to your lordship
is without end.... What I have done is yours;
what I have to do is yours: being part in all I
have devoted yours. Were my worth greater,
my duty would show greater." This bears a
singularly close resemblance to Sonnet xxvi.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232" href="#Page_232">[232]</a></span>—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage</div>
<div class="i0">Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit,</div>
<div class="i0">To thee I send this written embassage</div>
<div class="i0">To witness duty, not to show my wit,</div>
<div class="i0">Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine</div>
<div class="i0">May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it."</div></div></div>

<p>And there is much in the Sonnets which can be
made to coincide with what we know of Southampton.
But, as we push inquiry, difficulties of
all kinds begin to swarm in on us. The first is,
as in the case of Pembroke, with the dedication.
To say nothing of the fact that "W. H." is not
"H. W."—the possibility of the appellation of
"Mr." being applied to one who had been an
Earl since 1581, and who had twice been addressed
in dedications by his full titles, and that
by Shakespeare himself, is a wholly inadmissible
hypothesis. To argue that this was merely "a
blind," is simply to beg the question. If the
Sonnets were addressed to Southampton, they
must have been written between 1593 and 1598.
In 1593 Southampton was in his twenty-first
year, in 1598 in his twenty-sixth; Shakespeare,
respectively, in his thirty-first and thirty-fifth
year. Now, what is especially emphasized in the
sonnets is the youthfulness of the young man to
whom they are dedicated, and the advanced
age of the poet. In Sonnet cviii. the youth is
addressed as "a sweet boy," in cxxvi. as "a
lovely boy," in liv. as "a beauteous and lovely
youth"; in xcv. his "budding name" is referred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233" href="#Page_233">[233]</a></span>
to, while the poet speaks of himself as "old," as
"beaten and chopped with tanned antiquity," as
being "with Time's injurious hand crushed and
o'erworn." And so, as has been more than once
pointed out, we have this anomaly—a man of
thirty-four describing himself as a thing of
"tanned antiquity" in writing to "a sweet and
lovely boy" of twenty-five. No one could have
been less like the effeminate youth of the Sonnets
than Southampton. All we know about
him, including his portraits, indicates that he
was eminently masculine and manly. Again, it
is matter of history that he greatly distinguished
himself on the Azores expedition in
1597, acquitting himself with so much gallantry
that, during the voyage, he was knighted by
Essex. To this expedition, which must have
involved one of those absences of which we hear
so much in the Sonnets, to this exploit and this
honour, which afforded so much opportunity for
peculiarly acceptable compliment, Shakespeare
makes no reference at all. There is nothing to
indicate that the youth of the Sonnets had
gained any military or political distinction, had
taken any part in public life, or had ever been
absent from England. To assume with Mr. Lee
that the Sonnets were written in or before 1594,
and therefore before Southampton had become
distinguished, is to involve ourselves in inextricable
difficulties. Even Mr. Lee admits that
Sonnet cvii. must have reference to the death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234" href="#Page_234">[234]</a></span>
of Elizabeth in 1603. With regard to the
supposed references to Southampton's relations
with Elizabeth Vernon, no certain, or, to speak
more accurately, no even plausible inferences
can be drawn in any particular: all that they
can be reduced to are degrees of improbability.</p>

<p>If, again, we accept the theory of Tyrwhitt and
Malone, supported by Mr. Butler, and suppose
that W. H. was some obscure person, we are
proceeding on mere hypothesis, and a hypothesis
seriously shaken by the plain meaning expressed
in Sonnets xxxvi., xxxvii., and cxxiv.</p>

<p>The enigma of these Sonnets is, we repeat, as
insoluble now as it was when inquiry was first
directed to them. Whether they are to be regarded
as autobiographical, as dramatic studies,
as a mixture of both, as a collection of miscellaneous
poems, as written to order for others,
as mere exercises in the sonnet-cycle, or as all
of these things, is alike uncertain. Our knowledge
of the time of their composition begins
and ends with the facts, that some of them
were, presumably, in circulation in or before
1598, that two of them had certainly been composed
in or before 1599, and that all of them
had been written by 1609. The rest is mere
conjecture; and on mere conjecture and mere
hypothesis is based every attempt to solve
their mystery. If certainty about them can
ever be arrived at, it can only be attained by
evidence of which, as yet, we have not even an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235" href="#Page_235">[235]</a></span>
inkling. The probability is, that it was Shakespeare's
intention, or rather Thorpe's intention,
to baffle curiosity, and, except in the judgment
of fanatics, he has certainly succeeded in doing
so.</p>

<p>For our own part we are very much inclined
to suspect, that they owed their origin to the
fashion of composing sonnet-cycles, that those
cycles suggested their themes and gave them
the ply; that the beautiful youth, the rival poet,
and the dark lady are pure fictions of the
imagination; and that these poems are autobiographical
only in the sense in which <i>Venus and
Adonis</i>, the <i>Rape of Lucrece</i>, <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>
and <i>Othello</i> are autobiographical.</p>

Francis T. Palgrave.</p></div>


<p>It would be scarcely possible for a critic of
Mr. Palgrave's taste and learning to produce
a treatise on any aspect of poetry, which would
not be full of interest and instruction, and the
present volume is a contribution, and in some
respects a memorable contribution, to a particularly
attractive subject of critical inquiry.
Its purpose is to trace the history of descriptive
poetry in its relation, that is to say, to natural
objects and more particularly to landscape, by
illustrating its characteristics at different periods,
and among different nations. Beginning with
the Homeric poems, Mr. Palgrave reviews successively
the "landscape" of the Greeks, the
Romans, the Hebrews, the mediæval Italians,
the Celts, the Anglo-Saxons, and of our own
poets, from the predecessors of Chaucer to Lord
Tennyson. That a work, covering an area so
immense, should be far less satisfactory in some
portions than in others is no more than what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237" href="#Page_237">[237]</a></span>
might be expected, and Mr. Palgrave would
probably be himself the first to admit that, except
when he is dealing with the classical poetry
of Hellas, of ancient and mediæval Italy, and of
our own country, his treatise has no pretension
to adequacy. Even within these bounds there
is much which is irrelevant, and much which is
surprisingly defective. Where, as in a subject
like this, the material at the author's disposal is
necessarily so superabundant, surely the utmost
care should have been taken both to keep within
the limits of the theme proposed, and to select
the most pertinent and typical illustrations.
But when Mr. Palgrave illustrates "Homeric
landscape" by the simile describing the heifers
frisking about the drove of cows in the fold-yard,
and the "Sophoclean landscape" by the
simile of the blast-impelled wave rolling up the
shingle, he lays himself open to the imputation
of drawing at random on his commonplace
book. Indeed, the pleasure with which lovers
of classical poetry will read this book cannot
fail to be mingled with the liveliest surprise and
disappointment. Take the Homeric poems. If
a reader, tolerably well versed in the <i>Iliad</i> and
<i>Odyssey</i>, were asked for illustrations of the
power with which natural phenomena are described,
to what would he turn? Certainly not
to Mr. Palgrave's meagre and trivial examples,
three of which alone have any title to pertinence.
He would turn to the winter landscape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238" href="#Page_238">[238]</a></span>
in <i>Iliad</i>, xii. 278-286, to the lifting of the cloud
from the landscape in <i>Iliad</i>, xvi. 296:—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">

thick cloud from the high head of some mighty mountain,
and all the cliffs and the jutting crags and the dells start

<p>to the descent of the wind on the sea, <i>Ib.</i> xi.
305-308:—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">

<blockquote><p>"As when the west wind buffets the cloudlets of the
brightening south wind, lashing them with furious squall,
and the big wave swells up and rolls along, and the spray is
scattered on high by the blast of the careering gale";</p></blockquote>

<p>or to the pictures of the billow-buffeted headland,
and the wave bursting on the ship in <i>Iliad</i>, xv.
618-628; or to the storm-cloud coming over the
sea in <i>Iliad</i>, iv. 277; or to the descent of the
wind on the standing corn, <i>Iliad</i>, ii. 147. He
would point, above all, to the description of
Calypso's grotto, in <i>Odyssey</i>, v. 63-74; to that
of the harbour of Phorcys, in <i>Odyssey</i>, xiii.
97-112; to the fountain in the grove, xvii.
205-211. Mr. Palgrave comments justly on
Homer's minute observation of nature; but he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239" href="#Page_239">[239]</a></span>
only gives one illustration, where it is noticed in
<i>Odyssey</i>, vi. 94, that the sea, in beating on the
coast, "washed the pebbles clean." He might
have added with propriety many others: as
the "earth blackening behind the plough," in
<i>Iliad</i>, xviii. 548; the bats in the cave, <i>Odyssey</i>,
xxiv. 5-8; the birds escaping from the vultures,
<i>Iliad</i>, xxii. 304, 305; the wasps "wriggling as
far as the middle," <ins title="sphêkes meson aioloi">σφηκες μεσον αιολοι</ins>, <i>Iliad</i>,
xii. 167; the dogs and the lions, <i>Iliad</i>, xviii.
585, 586.</p>

<p>Mr. Palgrave observes that Homer "was not
only familiar with the sea, but loved it with a
love somewhat unusual in poets." We venture
to submit that there is not a line in Homer
indicating that he "loved" the sea, except for
poetical purposes; like most of the Greeks he
probably dreaded it; his real feeling towards
it is no doubt indicated in his own words:—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0"><ins title="ou gar egô ge ti phêmi kakôteron allo thalassês">ου γαρ εγω γε τι φημι κακωτερον αλλο θαλασσης</ins></div>
<div class="i0"><ins title="andra ge suncheuai.">ανδρα γε συγχευαι.</ins></div></div></div>

<p>—nothing crushes a man's spirit more than
the sea. Mr. Palgrave justly points out that
Hesiod's rude prosaic style and matter are not
congenial to the poetic landscape, yet it is only
fair to Hesiod to say, that his poetry is not without
vivid touches of natural description, as the
winter scene in <i>Works and Days</i>, 504 sqq., and
his description of the beginning of spring,
565-569, show. Professor Palgrave next glances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240" href="#Page_240">[240]</a></span>
at the treatment of nature in the lyric poets,
and very properly cites the lovely fragment of
Alcman:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">

<p>but in translating it makes a truly extraordinary
blunder.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Would I were the kingfisher, as he flies, with his mates
<i>in his feeble age</i>, between wind and water."</p></blockquote>

<p><ins title="nêleges êtor">νηλεγες ητορ</ins> meaning, as we need hardly say,
"reckless heart"; it is exactly Byron's, "With
all her <i>reckless</i> birds upon the wing." In
the quotations from Sappho, Ibycus, and
Pindar, Mr. Palgrave has been judicious and
happy, but surely he ought to have found place
for the lovely flower cradle of Iamus in the sixth
Olympic Ode, and for the moonlight evening
in the third Olympian,—only seven words, but
what a picture!—while, in the popular poetry,
the omission of the Swallow Song is inexplicable.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
Nor can we forgive him the omission
of the magnificent simile of the spring wind
clearing away the clouds, in the thirteenth of
the fragments attributed to Solon.</p>

<p>But it is in dealing with the Greek dramatists
that Mr. Palgrave is most defective in illustration.
It is not to the opening of the <i>Prometheus</i>, or to
the conclusion, or, indeed, to any of the passages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241" href="#Page_241">[241]</a></span>
from this poet which Mr. Palgrave cites, that
we must turn for Æschylean landscape, or for
illustration of this poet's power of natural description.
It is to his brief picture—his pictures
of scenery, though singularly vivid, are always
brief—of the airy seat "against which the
watery clouds drift into snow,"</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0"><ins title="lissas aigilips aprosdeiktos oiophrôn kremas">λισσας αιγιλιψ απροσδεικτος οιοφρων κρεμας</ins></div>
<div class="i0"><ins title="gypias petra">γυπιας πετρα</ins> (<i>Supplices</i>, 772-3),</div></div></div>

<p>where almost every word is a perfect picture,
literally beggaring mere translation; it is to his
description, so magical in its rhythm, of the
mid-day sea slumbering in summer calm (<i>Agamemnon</i>,
548-50),</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">

<p>to his picture of the keen brisk wind, clearing
the clouds away, to bring into relief against the
sky the dark masses of waves tossing on the horizon
(<i>Agamemnon</i>, 1152-54), to his world-famous</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">

<br />
<div class="i0">"The multitudinous laughter of the ocean waves."</div>
<div class="i10">—<i>Prometheus</i>, 89-90.</div></div></div>

<p>Mr. Palgrave has, of course, cited with reference
to Sophocles the great chorus in the <i>Œdipus
Coloneus</i>, but he has omitted to notice that, if
Sophocles has not elsewhere given us so elaborate
a piece of natural description, innumerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242" href="#Page_242">[242]</a></span>
touches in the dramas, and more particularly in
the fragments, show that he observed nature
almost as minutely as Shakespeare. Nothing
could be more vivid than the touches of description
in the <i>Philoctetes</i>. From Euripides Mr. Palgrave
cites nothing, observing that he rarely goes
beyond somewhat conventional phrases. Surely
Mr. Palgrave must have forgotten the magnificent
description of Parnassus, as seen from the
plain, in the <i>Phœnissæ</i>, the glorious description
of a moonlight night, as represented on the
tapestry, in the <i>Ion</i>, the vivid touches of natural
description in the <i>Bacchæ</i>, that of the meadow
in the <i>Hippolytus</i>, and the chorus about Athens
in the <i>Medea</i>, to say nothing of the charming
rural picture in the fragments of the <i>Phaeton</i>.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
To say of Aristophanes that, in his treatment of
nature, he rarely goes beyond somewhat common
phrases, is to say what is refuted, not merely in
the chorus referred to by Mr. Palgrave, but in
the <i>Frogs</i> and in the <i>Birds</i>. He stands next to
Homer in his keen sensibility to the charm of
nature. Shelley himself might have written
the choruses referred to. In dealing with the
Alexandrian poets Mr. Palgrave passes over
Apollonius Rhodius and Callimachus entirely,
and yet the fine picture of Delos given by Callimachus
in the Hymn to Delos is one of the
gems of ancient description, and Apollonius
Rhodius abounds with the most graphic and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243" href="#Page_243">[243]</a></span>
charming delineations of scenery and natural
objects. What a beautiful description of early
morning is this!—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0"><ins title="êmos d' ouranothen charopê hypolampetai êôs">ημος δ' ουρανοθεν χαροπη ὑπολαμπεται ηως</ins></div>

<div class="i11"><i>Argon.</i> i. 1280-1283.</div></div></div>

<blockquote><p>"What time from heaven the bright glad morn coming up
from the East begins to shine, and path and road are all
agleam, and the dew-bespangled plains are flashing with the
radiant light."</p></blockquote>

<p>How vivid too, and with the vividness of modern
poetry, are his descriptions of the cave of Hades
and its neighbourhood (ii. 729-750), and the
Great Syrtis (iv. 1230-1245)! In his selections
from the Greek Anthology Mr. Palgrave is much
happier; but here again he has many omissions,
and among them the most remarkable illustration
of Greek nature-painting to be found in
that collection—namely, Meleager's idyll giving
an elaborate description of a spring day, which
might have been written by Thomson (<i>Pal.
Anthology</i>, ix. 363). It may be observed in
passing that <ins title="ouresiphoita krina">ουρεσιφοιτα κρινα</ins> (<i>Pal. Anth.</i>, v. 144)
can hardly mean "lilies that wander over the
hills," but lilies "that haunt the hills," and that
<ins title="xouthai melissai">ξουθαι μελισσαι</ins> in Theocritus, vii. 142, probably
means "buzzing" bees, not "tawny."</p>

<p>In dealing with the Roman poets Mr. Palgrave
is, with one exception, most unsatisfactory.
From the poets preceding Lucretius, amply as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244" href="#Page_244">[244]</a></span>
the fragments would serve his purpose, he gives
only one illustration. We should have expected
the vivid picture given by Accius in his <i>Œnomaus</i>
of the early morning:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"Forte ante Auroram, radiorum ardentum indicem,</div>
<div class="i0">Cum e somno in segetem agrestis cornutos cient,</div>
<div class="i0">Ut rorulentas terras ferro rufidas</div>
<div class="i0">Proscindant, glebasque arvo ex molli exsuscitent."</div></div></div>

<blockquote><p>"Perchance before the dawn that heralds the burning rays,
what time rustics bring forth the oxen from their sleep into
the cornfields, to break up the red dew-spangled soil with the
ploughshare, and turn up the clods from the soft soil";</p></blockquote>

<p>or the wonderfully graphic description of a
sudden storm at sea, in the fragments of the
<i>Dulorestes</i> of Pacuvius:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i1">"Profectione læti piscium lasciviam</div>
<div class="i0">Intuentur, nec tuendi capere satietas potest.</div>
<div class="i0">Interea prope jam occidente sole inhorrescit mare,</div>
<div class="i0">Tenebræ conduplicantur, noctisque et nimbum occæcat nigror,</div>
<div class="i0">Flamma inter nubes coruscat, cælum tonitru contremit,</div>
<div class="i0">Grando mixta imbri largifico subita præcipitans cadit,</div>
<div class="i0">Undique omnes venti erumpunt, sævi existunt turbines,</div>
<div class="i0">Fervit æstu pelagus."</div></div></div>

<blockquote><p>"Glad at heart when they set out they gaze at the sporting
fish, and are never weary of looking at them. Meanwhile,
hard upon sunset, the sea ruffles, darkness gathers thick, the
blackness of the storm-clouded night hides everything, flame
flashes between the clouds, heaven shakes with thunder,
hail, mingled with streaming rain, dashes suddenly down,
from every quarter all the winds tear forth, wild whirlwinds
rise, the sea boils with the seething waters."</p></blockquote>

<p>With Lucretius, indeed, he deals fully, and this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245" href="#Page_245">[245]</a></span>
portion of his work leaves little to be desired.
But a reference to the lines to Sirmio and one
illustration from the <i>Peleus and Thetis</i> exhaust
his examples from Catullus. We should have
expected the picture of the stream leaping from
the mossy rock into the valley beneath, in the
Epistle to Manlius, of the morning chasing
away the shadows in the <i>Attis</i>, and the lovely
flower pictures in the Epithalamia. In dealing
with Virgil most of Mr. Palgrave's citations
are practically irrelevant; scarcely any of the
passages which best illustrate Virgil's power
of landscape painting being even referred to.
"The <i>Æneid</i>," says Mr. Palgrave, "may be
briefly dismissed. Natural description can
have but little place in an epic." And yet
what are the passages to which any one, who
wishes to illustrate the charm and power of
Virgil's pictures of scenery, would naturally
turn? Surely to these: the description of the
rocky recess which sheltered Æneas's ships
(<i>Æneid</i>, i. 159-168), a picture worthy of Salvator;
the picture of Ætna (iii. 570-582), which
rivals the picture of it given by Pindar, a picture
praised so justly by Mr. Palgrave himself; the
description of a calm night (iv. 522-527); the
wave-buffeted, gull-haunted rock (v. 124-128);
and, above all, the scenery at the mouth of the
Tiber, bathed in the rays of the morning sun,
a picture unexcelled even by Tennyson. Nor
even in the <i>Georgics</i> is any reference made to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246" href="#Page_246">[246]</a></span>
the superb description of a storm in harvest
time (i. 216-334), or to the magnificent winter
piece (iii. 349-370).</p>

<p>The remarks about the indifference of Propertius
to natural scenery are most unjust.
What a charming picture is this!—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i1">"Grata domus Nymphis humida Thyniasin,</div>
<div class="i0">Quam supra nullæ pendebant debita curæ</div>
<div class="i1">Roscida desertis poma sub arboribus;</div>
<div class="i0">Et circum irriguo surgebant lilia prato</div>
<div class="i1">Candida purpureis mixta papaveribus."</div>
<div class="i10"><i>El.</i>, I. xx. 35-39.</div></div></div>

<p>It may be conceded that Ovid is conventional
and commonplace in his treatment of nature; but
why is Valerius Flaccus, with his bold, vivid
touches, left unnoticed? Why does one citation
suffice for the many exquisite cameos which
ought to have been given from Statius? Another
inexplicable omission in Mr. Palgrave's work is
the poem entitled <i>Rosæ</i>, attributed to Ausonius—a
lovely poem, infinitely more beautiful
than the epigram quoted by Mr. Palgrave from
the Latin Anthology, and rivalling the fragment
given by him from Tiberianus. Most readers
would agree with him in his estimate of Claudian,
but he might have added the fine description of
Olympus in the <i>De Consulatu Theodori</i>, 200-210:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i6">"Ut altus Olympi</div>
<div class="i0">Vertex, qui spatio ventos hiemesque relinquit,</div>
<div class="i0">Perpetuum nullâ temeratus nube serenum</div>
<div class="i0">Celsior exsurgit pluviis, auditque ruentes</div>
<div class="i0">Sub pedibus nimbos, et rauca tonitrua calcat;"</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247" href="#Page_247">[247]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>which Goldsmith, by the way, has borrowed and
paraphrased in the <i>Deserted Village</i>, together with
its sublime application:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">As some tall cliff that lifts its awful form</div>
<div class="i0">Swells from the vale and midway leaves the storm,</div>
<div class="i0">Though round its breast the rolling clouds are spread,</div>
<div class="i0">Eternal sunshine settles round its head.</div></div></div>

<p>Space does not serve to follow Mr. Palgrave
through his chapters on Italian, Celtic, and Anglo-Saxon
poetry, in all of which his omissions are
as remarkable as his citations; so we must content
ourselves with making a few remarks on
his treatment of the English poets. It is pleasing
to see that, guided by Gray, he has done justice
to Lydgate, but he has not noticed the distinguishing
peculiarity of this poet in his description,
his extraordinary sensitive appreciation of
colour.</p>

<p>Among the Scotch poets of the fifteenth century
a prominent place should have been given
to Henryson who is not even mentioned. Mr.
Palgrave hurries over the Elizabethan poets
with too much expedition, and the poets of the
eighteenth century fare even worse. Great injustice
is done to Thomson. Why did not Mr.
Palgrave, instead of citing what he calls Thomson's
"cold" tropical landscape, for the purpose
of contrasting it unfavourably with Tennyson's
picture in <i>Enoch Arden</i>, give us instead the
Summer morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248" href="#Page_248">[248]</a></span>—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"At first faint gleaming in the dappled East</div>
<div class="i0">... Young day pours in apace,</div>
<div class="i0">And opens all the lawny prospect wide,</div>
<div class="i0">The dripping rock, the mountain's misty tops</div>
<div class="i0">Swell on the sight, and brighten with the dawn,</div>
<div class="i0">Blue through the dusk the smoking currents shine,"</div></div></div>

<p>or</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i3">"The clouds that pass,</div>
<div class="i0">For ever flushing round a summer sky";</div></div></div>

<p>or the rainbow in the <i>Lines to the Memory of
Sir Isaac Newton</i>? Dyer may be somewhat
prosaic, but he is not a poet to be despatched in
a treatise on descriptive poetry, without citation,
in a few contemptuous lines: how vivid is his
picture of a calm in the tropics!—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"The dewy feather, on the cordage hung,</div>
<div class="i0">Moves not; the flat sea shines, like yellow gold</div>
<div class="i0">Fused in the fire";</div></div></div>

<p>or his</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i2">"Rocks in ever-wild</div>
<div class="i0">Posture of falling";</div></div></div>

<p>or the charming landscape in <i>Grongar Hill</i> with
such touches as these:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"The windy summit wild and high</div>
<div class="i0">Roughly rushing on the sky";</div></div></div>

<p>or</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"Rushing from the woods the spires</div>
<div class="i0">Seem from hence ascending fires."</div></div></div>

<p>As Wordsworth said, "Dyer's beauties are innumerable
and of a high order." It is very surprising
that nothing should have been said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249" href="#Page_249">[249]</a></span>
about Shenstone and the Wartons, about Scott of
Amwell, Jago, Crowe and Bowles, all of whom are,
in various ways, remarkable as descriptive poets.
And certainly Mr. Palgrave does scant justice to
Cowper; his touch may be prosaic, but he always
had his eye on the object, and his landscape
lives. Surely, by the way, Mr. Palgrave is mistaken
in supposing that Shelley apparently
understood Alastor to mean a "wanderer"; he
understood it, as the preface shows, to mean,
what it means so often in Greek, "one under the
spell of an avenging deity."</p>

<p>Here we must break off. Mr. Palgrave's is an
important work, and it is the duty, therefore, of
a critic to review it seriously, in the hope that,
should it reach a second edition, which may be
confidently anticipated, Mr. Palgrave may be
disposed to do a little more justice to his most
interesting subject.</p>

<blockquote><p>Since this article was written Mr. Palgrave's lamented
death has unhappily rendered all hope of what was anticipated
in the last paragraph, vain. But the review has been
reprinted, and with some additions, in the hope that it may
not be unacceptable as a contribution, however slight and
imperfect, to a subject of great interest to lovers of poetry.</p></blockquote>

<h2><a name="AN_APPRECIATION_OF_PROFESSOR_PALGRAVE" id="AN_APPRECIATION_OF_PROFESSOR_PALGRAVE">
</a>AN APPRECIATION OF PROFESSOR PALGRAVE</h2>


<p>A familiar figure in literary circles, a fine
critic, a graceful and scholarly minor
poet, and one whose name will long be held in
affectionate remembrance by lovers of English
poetry, has passed away in the person of Francis
Turner Palgrave. It would be absurd to place
him beside Matthew Arnold—to whose genius, to
whose characteristic accomplishments, to whose
authority and influence, he had no pretension.
And yet it may be questioned whether, after
Arnold, any other critic of our time contributed
so much to educate public taste where, in this
country, it most needs such education. If, as a
nurse of poets and in poetic achievement, England
stands second to no nation in Europe, in no
nation in the world has the standard of popular
taste been so low, has the insensibility to what
is excellent, and the perverse preference of what
is mediocre to what is of the first order, been so
signally, so deplorably, conspicuous. The generation
which produced Wordsworth preferred
Moore, and no less a person than the author
of <i>Vanity Fair</i> wrote:—"Old daddy Wordsworth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251" href="#Page_251">[251]</a></span>
may bless his stars if he ever gets high
enough in Heaven to black Tommy Moore's
boots." While the readers of Keats might have
been numbered on his fingers, Robert Montgomery's
<i>Satan</i> and <i>Omnipresence of the Deity</i>
were going through their twelfth editions.
During many years, for ten readers of Browning's
poems there were a hundred thousand
for Martin Tupper's <i>Proverbial Philosophy</i>, while
the popularity of Mrs. Browning was as a wan
shadow to the meridian splendour of Eliza
Cook. Whoever will turn to the criticism of
current reviews and magazines forty years ago
will have no difficulty in understanding the
diathesis described by Matthew Arnold as "on
the side of beauty and taste, vulgarity; on the
side of morality and feeling, coarseness; on the
side of mind and spirit, unintelligence." Whoever
will turn to nine out of the ten Anthologies,
most in vogue before 1861, will understand,
that the same instinct which in the Dark
Ages led man to prefer Sedulius and Avitus to
Catullus and Horace, Statius to Virgil, and
Hroswitha to Terence, led these editors to analogous
selections.</p>

<p>Making every allowance for the co-operation
of other causes, it would hardly be an exaggeration
to say that the appearance of the <i>Golden
Treasury of Songs and Lyrics</i> in 1861 initiated
an era in popular taste. It remains now incomparably
the best selection of its kind in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252" href="#Page_252">[252]</a></span>
existence. Its <a name="Correct13" id="Correct13">distinctive feature is the characteristic</a>
which differentiates it from all the anthologies
which preceded or have followed it. It was
to include nothing which was not first-rate;
there was to be no compromise with the second-rate;
if its gems varied, as gems do in value,
each was to be of the first water. With patient
and scrupulous diligence, the whole body of
English poetry, from Surrey to Wordsworth, was
explored and sifted. After due rejections, each
piece in the residue was considered, weighed,
tested. And here Mr. Palgrave had assistance,
more invaluable than any other anthologist in
the world has had—that of the illustrious poet
to whom the volume was dedicated. It may be
safely said of Tennyson that nature and culture
had qualified him for being as great a critic as
he was a poet. His taste was probably infallible;
his touchstones and standards were derived not
merely from the masters who had taught him
his own art, but from a wonderfully catholic and
sympathetic communion with all that was best
in every sphere of influential artistic activity.
The consequence is, that a book like the <i>Golden
Treasury</i>, especially when taken in conjunction
with the notes, which form an admirable commentary
on the text, may be said to lay something
more than the foundation of a sound
critical education. What the <i>Golden Treasury</i>
is to readers of a maturer age the <i>Children's
Treasury</i> is to younger readers. It is a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253" href="#Page_253">[253]</a></span>
pity that such inferior works as many which we
could name are allowed, in our schools, to supplant
such a work as Palgrave's. The same exquisite
taste and nice discernment mark his other
anthologies, his selections from Herrick, and
Tennyson, and, though perhaps in a less degree,
his <i>Treasury of English Sacred Poetry</i>, and
his recently published supplement to the <i>Golden
Treasury</i>. It is probably impossible to over-estimate
the salutary influence which these
works have exercised.</p>

<p>There is no arguing on matters of taste, and
exception might easily be taken, sometimes, to his
dicta as a critic. But this at least must be conceded
by everybody, that in the best and most
comprehensive sense of the term he was a man
of classical temper, taste, and culture, and that
he had all the insight and discernment, all the
instincts and sympathies, which are the result of
such qualifications. He had no taint of vulgarity,
of charlatanism, of insincerity. He never talked
or wrote the cant of the cliques or of the multitude.
He understood and clung to what was
excellent; he had no toleration for what was
common and second rate; he was not of the
crowd. He belonged to the same type of men
as Matthew Arnold and William Cory, a type
peculiar to our old Universities before things
took the turn which they are taking now. It
will be long before we shall have such critics
again, and their loss is incalculable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254" href="#Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>As a scholar Palgrave was rather elegant
than profound or exact, and, to judge from a
series of lectures delivered by him as Professor
of Poetry at Oxford, on <i>Landscape in Classical
Poetry</i>, and afterwards published in a work
which is here reviewed, his acquaintance with
the Greek and Roman poets was, if scholarly
and sympathetic, somewhat superficial. But he
was getting old, and perhaps he had lost his
memory or his notes. As a poet he was the
author of four volumes, the earliest, published
in 1864, entitled <i>Idylls and Songs</i>, and the
latest, published in 1892, <i>Amenophis; and other
Poems</i>. But his most ambitious effort appeared
in 1882, <i>Visions of England</i>, written with the
laudable purpose of stirring up in the young
the spirit of patriotism. His poetry may be
described, not inaptly, in the sentence in which
Dr. Johnson sums up the characteristics of
Addison's verses:—"Polished and pure, the
production of a mind too judicious to commit
faults, but not sufficiently vigorous to attain
excellence." Perhaps they served their end in
procuring for him the honourable appointment
which he filled competently for ten years—that
of the Professorship of Poetry at Oxford. It
may be said of him as was said of Southey, he
was a good man and not a bad poet, or of
Agricola, <i>decentior quam sublimior fuit</i>. But
as a critic of Belles Lettres he was excellent.</p>

Litt. D., LL.D. London.</p></div>


<p>That a second edition of Professor Butcher's
essays on <i>Some Aspects of the Greek Genius</i>
should have been called for so soon is assuredly
a very significant fact. And it is significant in
more ways than one. It not only goes far to
refute Lord Coleridge's theory that Greek has
lost its hold on modern life, but it furnishes one
of the many proofs, which we have recently had,
that people are beginning to understand what is
now to be expected from classical scholars, if
classical scholars are to hold their own in the
world of to-day, and that scholars are, in their
turn, aware that they no longer constitute an
esoteric guild for esoteric studies. The task of
the purely philological labourer has been accomplished.
During more than four centuries, succeeding
schools of literal critics have been toiling
to furnish mankind with the means of unlocking
the treasures of classical Greece. Till within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256" href="#Page_256">[256]</a></span>
comparatively recent times, the power of reading
the Greek classics with accuracy and ease
was an accomplishment beyond the reach of any
but specialists. Unless a student was prepared
to grapple with the difficulties of unsettled and
often unintelligible texts, to make his own grammar—nay,
his own dictionary—to choose between
conflicting and contradictory interpretations,
and, in a word, to possess all that now
would be required in a classical editor, it would
be impossible for him to read, with any comfort,
a chorus of Æschylus or Sophocles, an ode of
Pindar, or a speech in Thucydides. But now all
these difficulties have vanished. Excellent lexicons,
grammars, commentaries, and translations,
with settled texts, and editions of the principal
Greek classics so satisfactory that practically
they leave nothing to be desired, have rendered
what was once the monopoly of mere scholars
common property. The power of reading Greek
with accuracy and comfort is now, indeed, within
the reach of any person of average intelligence
and industry.</p>

<p>But prescription and tradition are tenacious of
their privileges. Greek has so long been regarded
as the inheritance of philologists, that
they are not prepared to resign what was once
their exclusive possession, without a struggle. It
is useless to point out to them that, if Greek is
to maintain its place in modern education, it can
only maintain it by virtue of its connection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257" href="#Page_257">[257]</a></span>
with the humanities, by virtue of its intrinsic
value as the expression of genius and art,
and of its historical value as the key to the
development and characteristics of the classics
of the modern world; by virtue, in fine, of its
relation to life, and its relation to History and
Criticism. The revival, indeed, of the <i>trivium</i>
and <i>quadrivium</i> of the Middle Ages would not
be an absurder anachronism than it is to draw
no distinction between the functions and aims of
classical scholarship, when it was, necessarily,
confined to philologists and specialists, and its
functions and aims at the present day. It has
been the obstinate determination on the part of
academic bodies not to recognise this distinction,
but to preserve Greek as the monopoly of those
who approach it only on the side of philological
specialism, which has led to its complete dissociation
in our scholastic system from what
constitutes its chief, almost its sole title to preservation.
At Cambridge, for example, it has
been expressly excluded from the only School in
which the study of Literature has been organized,
and an attempt to substitute Modern
Languages in its place—for a degree in arts—was
only defeated by the intervention of non-resident
members of the University. At Oxford
a scheme for a "School of Literature," in which
Greek was to have no place, might, not long ago
have been carried, and the casting vote of the
proctor alone saved the University from this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258" href="#Page_258">[258]</a></span>
disgrace, and Greek from a crushing blow.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> But,
fortunately for the cause of Greek, there is every
indication that a reaction, too strong for academic
bodies to resist, is setting in. Scholars are
beginning to see that what Socrates did for Philosophy
must now be done for Greek, if Greek is
to hold its own. Thus, it has preserved, and no
doubt may preserve, its esoteric side; but that
which constitutes its chief, its real importance—which
justifies its retention in modern education—is
not what appeals, and can only appeal, in
each generation, to a small circle of "specialists"—its
philological interest, but what appeals to
liberal intelligence, to men as men, to the poet,
to the philosopher, to the orator, to the critic.
To this end, to what may be described as the
vitalization of Greek, all the labours of the
late Professor Jowett were directed; and by
his means Plato, Thucydides, and Aristotle are
brought into influential relation with modern
life. What he effected for them Professor Jebb
has effected for Sophocles, and not only has this
unrivalled Greek scholar placed within the reach
of any person of average intelligence all that is
necessary for the elucidation of the language,
art, and philosophy of the Shakespeare of the
Athenian stage, but he has not disdained to furnish
a popular manual of Homeric study, and a
popular elementary guide-book to Greek literature.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259" href="#Page_259">[259]</a></span>
Professor Lewis Campbell has laboured
in the same field and in the same cause. Great
also have been the services rendered to the
popularization of Greek by Mr. Andrew Lang,
Mr. Ernest Myers, Mr. Walter Leaf, and many
other distinguished scholars, all of whom have
shown, both by their published works and as
lecturers, that the masterpieces of ancient Greece
may become as intelligible and influential in the
world of to-day as they were more than two
thousand years ago.</p>

<p>We welcome with joy the advent of Professor
Butcher among these prophets. Few names
stand higher than his in the roll of modern
scholars, and assuredly few modern scholars
possess, in so large a measure, the power of
applying scholarship to the purposes of liberal
criticism and exegesis. He has written a delightful
book, in a pleasant style, full of learning,
suggestive, stimulating, a book which no student
of Greek literature can lay down without a
hearty feeling of gratitude to the author. Porson
said of Bentley that more might be learned from
his work when he was in error than from the
work of a rival scholar when he was in the
right. We shall not presume to accuse Professor
Butcher of error, but we are bound to say that
there is much in his book which appears to us
very questionable, and much also from which we
entirely dissent.</p>

<p>Professor Butcher discusses, for example, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260" href="#Page_260">[260]</a></span>
great length, the leading characteristics of the
Greek temper, but, in drawing his conclusions,
he has not sufficiently distinguished between
what was more or less accidental and what
was essentially peculiar. The fact is that nothing
is so easy as generalisations of this kind,
if the deduction of half truth be our aim; and
nothing so difficult if whole truth, or truth which
may be accepted without reserve, is to be the
result. The most mobile, plastic, Protean people
who have ever lived, their activity, within the
strict limits of classical literature, extended over
about six centuries, and, if we protract it to
the point included in Professor Butcher's illustrations,
to more than nine centuries. Of their
literature, though we appear to have the best
of it, not a third part has survived. By an adroit
use of illustration, it is, therefore, easy to predicate
anything of them. Go to serious epic, to
serious as distinguished from passionate lyric,
to tragedy, to threnody, and they were, if you
please, the gravest people on earth's face; go
to Aristophanes and to the poets of the Old
Comedy, and they were the merriest; go to the
Ionic Elegists and to the fragments of the New
Comedy, and they were the saddest and most
cynical; go to Thucydides, Plato, and Aristotle,
and they were, like Dante's sages, <i>ni tristi
ni lieti</i>. We do not quarrel with Professor
Butcher's general position in his Essay on the
melancholy of the Greeks, or question that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261" href="#Page_261">[261]</a></span>
there existed in certain moods a profound
melancholy and dissatisfaction with life in the
Greek temper. But of what intelligent and
reflective people or individual who have ever
existed is this not equally true? Where we
do quarrel with Professor Butcher is on the
following point, the point on which he chiefly
rests in proving that the Greeks were pre-eminently
distinguished by pessimistic melancholy—an
assertion that we deny <i>in toto</i>. He
tells us that, with one notable exception, to which
he subsequently adds three others, the Greeks
regarded hope not as a solace and support in
life, but as a snare and a delusion, not as a
power to cling to, but as an influence fraught with
mischief. Nothing surely can be more erroneous.
The wisest people who have ever lived are not
likely to have confounded baseless and flighty
desires or aspirations with what is implied in
hope, though Professor Butcher has done so in
the illustrations advanced by him in support of
his theory. All through Greek literature, from
Hesiod to Theocritus—not to go further—the
importance and wisdom of cherishing hope, as
one of the chief supports of life, are emphatically
dwelt on. Professor Butcher has surely misrepresented—certainly
Æschylus and the Greeks
generally did not interpret it in the sense in
which he has done—the fable of Pandora's chest.
It was not "as part of the deadly gift of the
goddess" that hope was there; it was as the one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262" href="#Page_262">[262]</a></span>
blessing amid the crowd of ills. "As long as a
man lives," says Theognis, "let him wait on
hope.... Let him pray to the gods; and to
Hope let him sacrifice first and last" (1143-1146).
Pindar, if he warns man against baseless,
wild, or extravagant expectation, is emphatic
on the wisdom of cherishing hope. It is
"the sweet nurse of the heart in old age," "the
chief helmsman of man's versatile will." (<i>Fragment</i>,
233.) "A man should cherish good hope."
(<i>Isth.</i>, vii. 15.) "It is the wing on which soaring
manhood is supported." (Pythian, viii. 93.)
"The wise," says Euripides, "must cherish
hope." (<i>Frag. of Ino.</i>) Again: "Prudent hope
must be your stay in misfortune." (<i>Id.</i>) Life,
he says in the <i>Troades</i> (628), is preferable to
death, in that it has hopes. A sentiment repeated
by Euripides again in the <i>Hercules
Furens</i> (105-6): "That man is the bravest who
trusts to hope under all circumstances; to be
without hope is the part of a coward." So
Menander: "Hold before yourself the shield of
good hope." (<i>Incert. Frag.</i> xlvii.) The passages
quoted by Professor Butcher from Thucydides
are not to the point. It would have
been much more to the point had he quoted
the passage in which Pericles eulogizes those
who "committed to hope the uncertainty of
success" (II. 42), or the passage (I. 70) in
which the superiority of the Athenians to the
Lacedæmonians in civil and military efficiency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263" href="#Page_263">[263]</a></span>
is largely attributed to their reliance on hope.
Again, what, according to Cephalus, in the
<i>Republic</i>, is the chief solace of old age?—"The
abiding presence of sweet hope." But it
would be easy to multiply indefinitely from the
Greek classics what Professor Butcher calls
"rare examples of hope in the happier aspect."</p>

<p>The most important chapters in Professor
Butcher's work—indeed they occupy nearly one
half of it—are those dealing with Aristotle's
theory of fine art and poetry. On no subject
in criticism have there been so many misconceptions
current and influential even among
scholars, originating for the most part from mistranslations
and misunderstandings of the treatise
in which they find their chief embodiment—the
<i>Poetics</i>. This has unfortunately come down
to us in a very imperfect and corrupt state, and,
what is more unfortunate still, it became a classic
in criticism long before it was properly understood.
Thus, in the clause in the famous definition
of tragedy, where Aristotle describes it as <ins title="di' eleou kai phobou perainousa tên tôn toioutôn
pathêmatôn katharsin">δι' ελεου
και φοβου περαινουσα την των τοιουτων παθηματων
καθαρσιν</ins>, "through pity and fear effecting the purgation
of these emotions," the French and English
critics of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,
ignoring the words <ins title="tôn toioutôn">των τοιουτων</ins>, have
totally misinterpreted the passage, and given it
a meaning which was not only not intended by
Aristotle, but which has falsified his whole
theory of the scope and functions of tragedy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264" href="#Page_264">[264]</a></span>
An unsound text, the insertion of <ins title="alla">αλλα</ins> before
the clause, sent Lessing on a wrong track. From
the misinterpretation of another passage in the
treatise (V. 4) has been deduced the famous
doctrine of the Unities. The mistranslation of
<ins title="spoudaios">σπουδαιος</ins> in the definition of Tragedy, and of
the same word in the comparison between
Poetry and History, has led to misconceptions
on other points. The scholars who did most
in England to place the study of this treatise
on a sound footing were Twining and Tyrwhitt.
In the present century it has received exhaustive
illustration from Saint-Hilaire, Stahr, Susemihl,
Vahlen, Teichmüller, Ueberweg, Reinkens, Jacob
Bernays, and others; while such works as E.
Müller's <i>Geschichte der Theorie der Kunst bei den
Alten</i> have thrown general light on the question
of Greek æsthetics. That Professor Butcher has
not been able to advance anything new in these
essays is very creditable to him, for the simple
reason that, as all that is worth saying has been
said, his sole resource, had he attempted to be
original, would have been paradox and sophistry.
With regard to the question of the <i>Katharsis</i>,
it will probably be, for all time, a case of "quot
homines tot sententiæ"; and we have certainly
no intention of accompanying Professor Butcher
into this labyrinth. We entirely agree with
him and Bernays that the passage in the <i>Politics</i>
(V. viii. 7) settles conclusively at least one part
of the meaning, but we differ from Bernays,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265" href="#Page_265">[265]</a></span>
in contending that the "lustratio" is included,
and from Professor Butcher, in contending that
the "lustratio" is not effected merely by the relief.
Professor Butcher seems here indeed to be
a little confused, or at all events confusing. He
first explains "katharsis" as "a purging away of
the emotions of pity and fear," and then explains
it as "a purifying of them"; but it is neither
easy to understand how "purging away" is
"purifying," nor why we should "purify" what
we "purge away." Surely it is better—but we
speak with all submission—to take the word
in two different meanings, the one signifying
the immediate effect of tragedy in its direct
appeal to the passions referred to, the other
not to its immediate, but to its ulterior and
total effect in educating the passions thus excited.</p>

<p>Professor Butcher, who appears to belong to
the Pater School, dwells with great complacency
on the fact that Aristotle "attempted to separate
the function of æsthetics from that of
morals," that "he made the end of art reside
in a pleasurable emotion," that he says "nothing
of any moral aim in poetry," and that though
he often takes exception to Euripides as an artist,
"he attaches no blame to him for the immoral
tendency in some of his dramas," so severely
censured by Aristophanes. If Professor Butcher
implies, as he seems to imply by this, that
Aristotle would lend any countenance to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266" href="#Page_266">[266]</a></span>
modern art-for-art's-sake doctrine, and proceeded
on the assumption that there was no
necessary connection between æsthetics and
morals, he does Aristotle very great injustice,
and is refuted by the <i>Poetics</i> themselves. In
the fifth chapter Aristotle lays stress on the
fact that tragedy is, like epic, a representation
of "superior or morally good characters"
(<ins title="mimêsis spoudaiôn">μιμησις σπουδαιων</ins>)—that the characters are to
be good (<ins title="chrêsta">χρηστα</ins>). In the twenty-fifth chapter
he says that nothing can excuse the exhibition
of moral depravity (<ins title="mochthêria">μοχθηρια</ins>), unless it be one
of the things implicit in the plot; and that
among the most serious objections which can be
brought against a drama is that it is likely to
do moral harm (<ins title="blabera">βλαβερα</ins>). In the thirteenth
chapter he shows,—and on moral grounds,—why
the protagonist in a tragedy should not be a
perfectly good man or a perfectly bad man.
Indeed, the very definition of tragedy refutes
Professor Butcher's statement. It may be said,
no doubt, that Aristotle maintains that the end
of poetry is pleasure, but it must be "the proper
pleasure," and in the proper pleasure moral
satisfaction is implied.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> It is only by a quibble
that Professor Butcher's theory can be supported,
and it is a pity to quibble on subjects which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267" href="#Page_267">[267]</a></span>
may be so mischievously misunderstood. Aristotle
was, we suspect, very much nearer to
Ben Jonson and Milton than to Mr. Pater in his
conception of the functions and scope of poetry.</p>

<p>In the interesting essay on Sophocles there
are two statements which appear to us very
questionable. It is surely not true to say that
Sophocles was "the first of the Greeks who has
clearly realized that suffering is not always
penal." Who could have expressed this truth
more forcibly than Æschylus? To say nothing
of the well-known passage in the <i>Agamemnon</i>,
167-171:—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0"><ins title="Zêna ...">Ζηνα ...</ins></div>
<div class="i0"><ins title="ton phronein brotous hodôsanta, ton pathei mathos">τον φρονειν βροτους ὁδωσαντα, τον παθει μαθος</ins></div>
<div class="i0"><ins title="thenta kyriôs echein.">θεντα κυριως εχειν.</ins></div>
<div class="i0"><ins title="stazei d' en th' hypnô pro kardias">σταζει δ' εν θ' ὑπνω προ καρδιας</ins></div>
<div class="i0"><ins title="mnêsipêmôn ponos, kai par' akontas êlthe sôphronein,—">μνησιπημων πονος, και παρ' ακοντας ηλθε σωφρονειν,—</ins></div></div></div>

<p>the doctrine of which is repeated in 241-2 of
the same play, and in other passages in his
dramas, notably in <i>Choephoroe</i>, 950-955, and in
<i>Eumenides</i>, 495, <ins title="sympherei sôphronein hypo stenei">συμφερει σωφρονειν ὑπο στενει</ins>.
The fact that suffering and calamity have resulted
in blessing is emphasized as strongly in
the concluding drama of the Orestean Trilogy,
the <i>Eumenides</i>, as it is in the <i>Œdipus Coloneus</i>.
Again, when Professor Butcher says that "in
Sophocles the divine righteousness asserts itself
not in the award of happiness or misery to the
individual, but in the providential wisdom which
assigns to each individual his place and function<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268" href="#Page_268">[268]</a></span>
in a universal moral order," he says what it is
very difficult to understand. Surely in the case
of each one of the protagonists in Sophocles,
to employ the word in its non-technical sense,
their deserts are very exactly meted out. Antigone
deliberately courts her fate by setting the
law at defiance, though she knew what the
penalty was, and falls, but has her compensation
in the applause of her own conscience and "in
the faith that looks through death." Ajax
paid the penalty, as the poet emphasizes, for
brutality and impious insolence; Œdipus suffers
for his impetuosity and intemperance, but, his
punishment exceeding the offence, the balance
is adjusted for him in final triumph over the
sons who had wronged him, in procuring
blessings for his protector, in the peace of the
soul, and in a glorious death. Clytemnestra
and Ægisthus well deserve their fate, as, in
addition to committing their crime, they continue
ostentatiously to glory in it. In the
<i>Trachiniæ</i> Hercules is punished for a base
and cowardly murder, followed by an act of
cruel and indiscriminate vengeance, retribution
coming on him through the sister of the man
thus murdered, and the daughter of the prince
on whom this iniquitous vengeance had been
wreaked, as Deianeira, but for Iole, would not
have sent the poisoned tunic. Sophocles has
even altered the legend to emphasize the guilt
of Hercules. The <i>Philoctetes</i>, indeed, is the only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269" href="#Page_269">[269]</a></span>
play which lends any support to Professor Butcher's
statement. Here the gods undoubtedly
condemn a man to a life of torture that their
designs, irrespective of the individual, may be
fulfilled, and that Troy may not fall before the
appointed time; but how fully, how nobly is he
compensated! It seems to us that the award
of happiness and misery to the individual, in
accordance with desert, is as conspicuous in the
ethics of Sophocles as it is in the ethics of
Shakespeare. And it is the more conspicuous,
when we remember the hampering conditions
under which Sophocles had to work, the limitations
conventionally imposed on the treatment
of the legends.</p>

<p>We wish we had space to comment on Professor
Butcher's admirable, though somewhat
defective, chapter on the dawn of Romanticism
in Greek poetry, but we must forbear, and
repeat our thanks to him for a book full of
interest and instruction, not the least of its
charms being the lively and graceful style in
which it is written.</p>

Study of Literature.</i> By W. Basil Worsfold. London:
Allen.</p></div>


<p>Bishop Warburton said that there were
two things which every man thought himself
competent to do, to manage a small farm
and to drive a whisky. Had Warburton lived
in our time, he would probably have added a
third—to set up for a critic. What the author
of the best critical treatise in the Greek language
pronounced to be the final fruit of long experience,
culture, and study, directed and illumined
by certain natural qualifications, has now come
to be represented by the idle and irresponsible
gossip of any one who can gossip agreeably.
Agreeable gossip and good criticism are, as
Sainte-Beuve and others have shown, far
from being incompatible, the misfortune is that
they should be confounded; but confounded
they are, and the confusion is the curse of
current literature. We have recently observed,
with concern, that the rubbish which used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271" href="#Page_271">[271]</a></span>
formerly to be shot into novels and poems is
now being shot into criticism, and that there
appears to be a growing impression that the
accomplishments which qualify young men for
spinning cobwebs in fiction and manufacturing
versicles can, with a little management, serve
to set them up as critics. There is not much
more difficulty in forming an opinion about a
book than there is in reading it, and as criticism
in the hands of these fribbles becomes little
more than the dithyrambic expression of that
opinion, the profession of criticism is one in
which it is delightfully easy to graduate. It
requires neither learning nor knowledge, neither
culture nor discipline. It is neither science nor
art; it is the gift of nature, a sort of "lyric
inspiration." With principles, with touchstones,
with standards, it has nothing whatever to do.
Its business is to declaim, to coin phrases, to
juggle with fancies and to say "good things."</p>

<p>A writer, therefore, who tries to recall criticism
to a sense of its responsibilities and true
functions deserves all sympathy and encouragement.
It is refreshing to turn from the sort of
thing to which we have referred to such a work
as Mr. Worsfold has given us. His design is
"to present an account of the main principles
of literary criticism," which he professes to trace
from Plato to Matthew Arnold. Mr. Worsfold's
thesis simply stated is that criticism—and he
deals with criticism chiefly in its application to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272" href="#Page_272">[272]</a></span>
poetry—has passed successively through five
stages. With the Greeks it concerned itself
principally with form. "The first question it
asked with them was not, as with us, What is
the thought? but What is the form?" By Addison—for
here Mr. Worsfold makes a prodigious
leap over some twenty centuries—it was furnished
with a new test, and it asked, How does
a given poem affect the imagination? By Lessing
a return was made to the formal criticism
of the ancients, but he adopted also Addison's
criterion, and added definiteness to it. Victor
Cousin followed in 1818 with his lectures, entitled,
<i>Du Vrai, du Beau, et du Bien</i>, and
enlarged the boundaries of the science by a
complete theory of beauty and art, developed
mainly out of Plato. Lastly came Matthew
Arnold, who extended the realm still further, by
the addition of certain other important touchstones
of poetic excellence. At the present time
a gradual limitation of the scope of its rules,
and a gradual extension of the scope of its
principles, are the tendencies most discernible
in criticism. "An enlightened criticism no
longer aims at directing the artist by formulating
rules which, if they were valid, would
only tend to obliterate the distinction between
the fine and the technical arts. It allows him
to work by whatever methods he may choose,
and it is content to estimate his merit not by
reference to his method but by reference to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273" href="#Page_273">[273]</a></span>
achievement, as measured by principles of
universal validity."</p>

<p>All this is exceedingly ingenious, and has in it
a measure of truth, but, like most generalisations
on vast and complicated subjects, it is more
plausible than sound. The stages in the progress
of criticism are not so sharply defined as
Mr. Worsfold would have us believe. If Greek
criticism were represented only by Plato and the
extant works of Aristotle, English by Addison
and Matthew Arnold, German by Lessing, and
French by Victor Cousin, what Mr. Worsfold
postulates might, after a manner, pass muster.
But by far the greater portion of Greek criticism
has perished; it exists only in fragments, and to
the most important and remarkable work on
this subject which has come down to us from
antiquity, the <i>Treatise on the Sublime</i>, Mr. Worsfold
does not even refer. If he had done so, and
had he considered what is scattered fragmentarily
through the Greek writers, or may be
gathered from the titles of treatises which are
lost, he would have seen that much which he
supposes to mark development in criticism has
long been old. Innumerable passages in the
minor Greek critics, in Plutarch and in the
Scholia, especially if we add what is to be found
in Roman writers, derived no doubt from Greek
sources, amply warrant doubt whether, after all,
it is not with criticism as it is, to use Goethe's
expression, with wit, "Alles Gescheidte ist schon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274" href="#Page_274">[274]</a></span>
gedacht worden, man muss nur versuchen, es
noch einmal zu denken." At all events, it is a
great mistake to suppose that Greek criticism, in
its application to poetry, is represented by Plato
and Aristotle. It would be almost as absurd to
go to Plato for typical Greek criticism on poetry
as it would be to go to Henry More or the
Puritan Divines for typical English criticism.
He approached it only as such a philosopher
would be likely to approach it. He regarded
art and letters generally simply as means of
educational discipline and culture, or as mere
playthings, of which the best to be expected
was harmless pleasure. He despised poetry not
only as an appeal, and a perturbing appeal, to
the senses and the passions, but as representing
the shadows of shadows. It may be pronounced
with confidence that, had he seriously applied
himself to literary and artistic criticism, he
would have been one of the subtlest and profoundest
critics who ever lived, and would probably
have anticipated, so far as principles are
concerned, all that Mr. Worsfold attributes to
Addison, to Lessing, and to Victor Cousin; but,
like our own Ruskin, he was wilful and fanatical.</p>

<p>Still less is Greek criticism represented by
Aristotle. It is in the highest degree misleading
to generalize from such a work as the
<i>Poetics</i>. It is not merely a fragment, but a
fragment deformed by desperate corruption,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275" href="#Page_275">[275]</a></span>
hopeless interstices and contemptible interpolations.
If it confines itself, or in the main
confines itself, to formal criticism, it is simply
because it was designed to deal with that
particular department of criticism, not because
its author supposed that the chief question
which concerned criticism was form. Again,
if by form Mr. Worsfold understands, as he appears
to do, expression and structure, he very
much misrepresents the Treatise. Aristotle's
criterion of poetry is not its formal expression,
for he distinctly declares that it is not metre
which makes a poem, and even seems to maintain
that a poem may be composed without
metre. In Aristotle's definition and conception
of poetry as the concrete expression of the universal,
in his definition of the scope and functions
of tragedy, and in innumerable occasional
remarks we have the germs of much, and of
very much, which Mr. Worsfold would attribute
to the later developments of criticism.</p>

<p>Aristotle, it is true, derived his canons from an
analysis of the masterpieces of Greek poetry,
but it is doing him great injustice to say, that he
would make all epics Homeric, and all plays Sophoclean,
and most erroneous to assume that modern
criticism commenced at this point. Aristotle
distinctly questions whether tragedy had as yet
perfected its proper types or not (<i>Poet.</i>, IV. 11),
and in discussing the proper length of tragedy
he makes a remark which shows that such a plot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276" href="#Page_276">[276]</a></span>
as the plot of <i>Hamlet</i> or the plot of <i>Lear</i> would
have been quite compatible with his canons.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
The truth is that Mr. Worsfold has gone too
far; he has confounded the various aspects of
criticism with stages in its development. Aristotle
dealt mainly with form, because it was his
business to deal with form. Plato approached
poetry from a particular point of view, because
it was from that particular point of view that
it concerned him.</p>

<p>Had Mr. Worsfold taken his stand in his review
of ancient criticism on the treatise attributed
to Longinus, he would have seen that what
he so strangely attributes to Addison and later
writers had long been anticipated. This remarkable
work which, since its translation into French
by Boileau in 1674, has had more influence on
criticism both in England and on the Continent
than any other work that could be named, would
alone show how much we owe to the Greeks. It
has analyzed and defined, for all time, the essential
virtues and the essential vices of diction and
style, and has traced them to their sources. It
has furnished us with infallible criteria in judging
rhetoric and poetry. Take its analysis of the
"grand style," which is described comprehensively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277" href="#Page_277">[277]</a></span>
as <ins title="megalophrosynês apêchêma">μεγαλοφροσυνης απηχημα</ins>, "the echo of a great
soul"; it has, the Treatise tells us, five characteristics—richness
and grandeur of conception
(<ins title="to peri tas noêseis hadrepêbolon">το περι τας νοησεις ἁδρεπηβολον</ins>); vehement and
inspired passion (<ins title="to sphodron kai enthousiastikon pathos">το σφοδρον και ενθουσιαστικον
παθος</ins>), the due formation of figures, which are
twofold—first those of thought, and secondly
those of expression (<ins title="hê poia tôn schêmatôn plasis dissa de pou tauta, ta
men noêseôs, thatera de lexeôs">ἡ ποια των σχηματων πλασις
δισσα δε που ταυτα, τα μεν νοησεως, θατερα δε λεξεως</ins>);
noble diction (<ins title="hê gennaia, phrasis">ἡ γενναια, φρασις</ins>); dignified and
elevated composition (<ins title="hê en axiômati
kai diarsei synthesis">ἡ εν αξιωματι και διαρσει
συνθεσις</ins>). Nothing could be more masterly than
its detailed analysis of each of these qualities,
and of the pseudo forms which they assume, as
the result of stimulated enthusiasm. How admirable,
too, is its test of the sublime in the
seventh chapter; its criticism of Sappho, generalizing
what constitutes the charm and power of
lyric, in the tenth chapter; its analysis of the
eloquence of Demosthenes, again generalizing
the characteristics of oratory in perfection
(chap. xvii.); its demonstration of the inferiority
of correct mediocrity to the faulty
irregularities of inspired genius; its admirable
remarks about the relation of Art to Nature.
Like the <i>Poetics</i>, it has come down to us in a
very mutilated form, and has evidently been
interpolated by some inferior hand, which no
doubt accounts for the exasperating triviality of
some of the sections. Here, as elsewhere, we
have references to the many losses which Greek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278" href="#Page_278">[278]</a></span>
criticism has sustained, the author referring to
treatises written by him on Xenophon, on
Composition, and on the Passions.</p>

<p>It is impossible to give an adequate account of
the evolution of criticism without a very careful
survey of the chief contributors to criticism in
each generation, and such a survey Mr. Worsfold
has not attempted. To Latin criticism he never
even refers. And yet it has had great influence
on critical literature. The Romans, it is true,
contributed scarcely anything new to criticism,
except that which pertains to oratory. We
know enough of Varro, with whom Roman criticism
may be said to begin, to feel confident that
he could have had no pretension to the finer
qualities of the critic. Of the five treatises composed
by him, only one, the <ins title="peri charaktêrôn">περι χαρακτηρων</ins>,
appears to have been purely critical, and it
almost certainly drew largely on Greek sources.
Horace derived the material of the <i>Ars Poetica</i>
from a Greek writer, Neoptolemus of Parium.
Much of Quinctilian's criticism is demonstrably
a compilation from Greek writers. The best
critic of poetry among the Romans is undoubtedly
to be found in Petronius, occasional
and scanty though his remarks are. But of prose
literature Rome produced two really great critics—the
one was Cicero, the other was Tacitus.
The <i>Brutus</i> and the <i>Dialogus de Oratoribus</i> are
masterpieces, equal to anything which has come
down to us from the Greeks. One of the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279" href="#Page_279">[279]</a></span>
important critical principles ever enunciated we
owe to Cicero. He was the first to demonstrate
that the test of excellence in oratory lay, in its appealing
equally to the multitude and to the most
fastidious of connoisseurs. The most consummate
rhetorician which the world has ever seen,
he was at the same time a consummate critic of
his art. This department of criticism has, indeed,
for nearly two thousand years, been practically
his monopoly; it may be questioned whether
anything can be added, so far as the technique
of rhetoric is concerned, to what may be traced
to his writings. The interest of the <i>Dialogus de
Oratoribus</i> is largely historical, but never have
the causes which inspire and nourish, or depress
and starve, eloquence been more eloquently and
brilliantly explained. Nor must it be forgotten
that it was through the medium of the Latin
critics that Greek criticism became influential on
modern literature.</p>

<p>Mr. Worsfold has very properly drawn attention
to the fine passage about poetry in the second
book of Bacon's <i>Advancement of Learning</i>, but
he says not a word about Sidney's remarkable
treatise, one of the most charming contributions
to the criticism of poetry which has ever been
made, or about the admirable remarks in Ben
Jonson's <i>Discoveries</i>. The interest of Elizabethan
criticism, as represented by these works—and
they are the only works on this subject of any
value produced during the Elizabethan period—lies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280" href="#Page_280">[280]</a></span>
partly in its return to Aristotelian canons,
and partly in the importance which, in accordance
with the ancients, it attaches to the didactic
element in poetry. This is expressed very eloquently
in Ben Jonson's dedication of the <i>Fox</i>:—</p>

<blockquote><p>"If men will impartially and not asquint look toward
the offices and function of a poet, they will easily conclude
to themselves the impossibility of a man's being the good
poet without being first the good man,—he that is able to inform
young men to all good discipline, inflame young men
to all good virtues, keep old men in their best and supreme
state, or, as they decline to childhood, recover them to their
first state, that comes forth the interpreter and arbiter of
nature, a teacher of things divine no less than human."</p></blockquote>

<p>This was precisely Spenser's conception of
one of the chief functions of poetry. Thus the
Elizabethan critics, who were followed afterwards
by Milton, if they did not formally discuss
the relation of æsthetic to ethic, insisted on
their essential connection in the higher forms of
poetry. Even in the succeeding age, when poetry
lost all its high seriousness and much of its
moral dignity, criticism, if it did not always insist
on the application of this test, still retained
it. Dryden could write, "I am satisfied if verse
cause delight, for delight is the chief, if not the
only end, of poesy"; but in adding "instruction
can be admitted but in the second place, for
poesy only instructs as it delights," he half corrected
his former statement, and, indeed, simply
reverted to what Aristophanes, Ben Jonson, and
Milton would have been the first to admit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281" href="#Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>But to return to Mr. Worsfold. A very serious
defect in his work is his omission of all notice
of Boileau and Dryden, and of the critics contemporary
with them in France and England.
The consequence is, that much is attributed to
Addison which belongs to them, and Addison's
importance as a critic is much overrated. Again,
of the many memorable contributions to this
branch of literature in England, in France, in
Italy, and in Germany, which were made between
the appearance of the Abbé Dubos's <i>Réflexions
critiques sur la poésie et la peinture</i> in 1719, and
the lectures of Coleridge and Schlegel about 1812,
all that is said is represented by what is said of
Lessing. Though a long chapter is given to
Matthew Arnold, Matthew Arnold's master,
Sainte-Beuve, is, if we remember rightly, not
so much as named.</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson divided critics into three classes—those
who know the rules and judge by them,
those who know no rules but judge entirely by
natural taste, those who know the rules but are
above them. This has been true in all ages, and
sufficiently disposes of Mr. Worsfold's hypothesis
about the stages through which criticism has
passed. All that can be said is, that at certain
times there has been a tendency, determined of
course by the character of the particular age, towards
the predominance of a particular critical
method and of particular points of view. Further
than this it would be perilous to go. It has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282" href="#Page_282">[282]</a></span>
been the task of the present age to develop each
of these methods to the full, and the most
authoritative critics of the last twenty years
might easily be ranged under one of those
classes.</p>

<p>The soundest and most valuable part of Mr.
Worsfold's book is the part dealing with the
criticism of the last few years. His chapter on
Matthew Arnold, in particular, is admirable,
and his remarks on the functions of criticism
at the present time, deduced as they have been
from Wordsworth, Arnold and Ruskin, are in
a high degree instructive and interesting. In
pointing out that criticism should not confine
itself merely to the investigation of technical
excellence, and to all that is implied in the
doctrine of Art for Art's sake, but should recognise
that there are limits beyond which the
artist should not exercise his technical skill, he
recalls us to principles which it is well that
criticism should not forget. We quite agree with
him that there is now an increasing tendency to
recognise these limits, and to lay most stress on
the interpretation of the ideal element in literature
and art. That is certainly the modern note.
We have expressed our reasons for dissenting
from Mr. Worsfold's historical view of the
evolution of criticism, but his book is full of
interest, and will amply repay the attention of
serious readers. It is a book which does not
deserve to be lost in the crowd.</p>

Greek Poetry.</i> By E. F. M. Benecke.</p></div>


<p>The editor of this book cannot be congratulated
either on his competence or on
his discretion. To hurry into the world a work
which is not merely a fragment, but which cries
for revision, suppression, and correction in almost
every page, is a literary crime of the first magnitude,
and deserves the severest castigation.
Of the author of the work, who appears to have
been a young man of some attainments and of
much promise, we desire to speak with all
gentleness; we wholly absolve him from blame,
for we have no right to assume that he would
himself have given to the world what his editor
admits was <i>intra penetralia Vestæ</i>, and what we
hope and believe he would himself have committed
<i>emendaturis ignibus</i>, had he arrived at
years of discretion. But the dissemination of
error is no light thing, especially in relation to
subjects which are of great interest, and, from
an historical and literary point of view, of great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284" href="#Page_284">[284]</a></span>
importance. When we think of the many amiable
and industrious tutors at Oxford and Cambridge
who, unless they are put on their guard,
will unsuspiciously fill their note-books with
the nonsense of this volume, and impart it, by
degrees, to the listening credulity of youth, we
feel we have no alternative but to perform a
plain, if painful, duty. We repeat, we absolve
the author from all blame; the sole culprit is
the editor.</p>

<p>That Solomon was the author of the <i>Iliad</i>,
Poggio the author of the <i>Annals</i> of Tacitus,
and Bacon the author of Shakespeare's plays,
are hypotheses scarcely less monstrously absurd
than the thesis propounded in this volume. Mr.
Benecke's main contentions are "that a pure
love between man and woman seemed to the
early Greeks" (that is, to those who lived
before the latter end of the Peloponnesian War)
a sheer impossibility; that "in extant Greek
poetry there is no trace of romantic love poetry
addressed to women prior to the time of Asclepiades
and Philetas"; that "in the works of
these writers this element suddenly appears
not in the nature of an experiment but as a
leading motive"; that the appearance of this
element was due to the influence of Antimachus,
"who was the first man who had
the courage to say that a woman was worth
loving, and who may thus be regarded as the
originator of the romantic element in literature."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285" href="#Page_285">[285]</a></span>
As we have not space to refute this
nonsense in detail, we will give some examples
of the way in which it is supported. First come
misrepresentations and blunders. To emphasize
the degradation of women, passages in translation
are twisted and perverted almost beyond
recognition.</p>

<p>Thus the couplet of Catullus—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"Tunc te dilexi, non tantum ut vulgus amicam,</div>
<div class="i0">Sed pater ut natos diligit et generos"—</div></div></div>

<p>is actually paraphrased "I loved you, not as
a man loves a woman, but as a man loves a
youth." The couplet in which Antigone says,
"If my husband died, I could get another, and
were I deprived of him too, I could be a mother
by another man"—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0"><ins title="posis men an moi, katthanontos, allos ên">ποσις μεν αν μοι, κατθανοντος, αλλος ην</ins></div>
<div class="i0"><ins title="kai pais ap' allou phôtos, ei toud' êmplakon—">και παις απ' αλλου φωτος, ει τουδ' ημπλακον—</ins></div></div></div>

<p>is translated "If my husband had died, I could
have married another, if he had failed to get me
children, I could have committed adultery." The
"main motive of the Iliad," we are informed,
(p. 76), "is the love of Achilles for Patroclus."
The interest of the <i>Ajax</i> "is meant to centre
on Teucer, the <i>amasius</i> of the dead Ajax." That
the <i>Alcestis</i> may not be pressed into the service
of those who would maintain that the Greeks
knew how to respect women, the key to it is to
be found "in the relation existing between Admetus
and Apollo"(!) The revolting coarseness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286" href="#Page_286">[286]</a></span>
and flippant vulgarity which mark the book, and,
which do very little credit to Oxford training, are
illustrated by the remarks employed to disparage
these types of womanhood which the writer well
knows would refute his theory. Thus of Nausicaa,
"she is always regarded as a charming
type of woman; but, after all, how one naturally
thinks of her is (<i>sic</i>) as a charming type of
washerwoman"; of Penelope, "she longs for
the return of her husband, no doubt; but what
really grieves her about the suitors is not their
suggestions as to his death, but the quantity of
pork they eat." On a par with this sort of thing
is the remark about a play of Sophocles, which,
by the way, is not extant, that "it merely drew
the usual picture of the gods playing shove-halfpenny
with human souls" (p. 47); or flippant
vulgarity like the following—Admetus expresses
"his deep regret that he cannot accompany
Alcestis, as Charon does not issue
return tickets." If this is the humour of young
Oxford, the progress of which we hear so much
has been purchased at a heavy price.</p>

<p>But to continue. On page 27 we are confronted
with the astounding statement that "it
is in Anacreon that we find for the first time
love-poetry addressed to a woman." Why, Hermesianax
(15, 16) distinctly states that Musæus
wrote love-poetry to his wife or mistress,
Antiope, and that Hesiod wrote many poems
in honour of his love, Eoia (<i>Id.</i> 22-24).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287" href="#Page_287">[287]</a></span>
Alcæus notoriously wrote love-poems to Sappho,
as we need go no further than the first book
of Aristotle's <i>Rhetoric</i> to know; both Alcman,
the lover of Egido and Megalostrate, and, probably
Ibycus also wrote love-poetry to women.
It is mere special pleading to contend that Mimnermus
did not write poetry to the mistress of
his affections, to whom, according to Strabo, his
erotic poetry was addressed. Hermesianax distinctly
states that Mimnermus was passionately
in love with Nanno, and certainly implies that
his love-poetry was addressed to her (35-38).
It is true that two of the fragments of Archilochus
are ambiguous, but one is not; and, if we
may judge by a single line (Fr. 71), his love for
Neobule expressed itself in a manner indistinguishable
from Petrarch's vein—"Would
that I might touch Neobule's hand": <ins title="ei gar hôs emoi
genoito cheira Neoboulês thigein">ει γαρ ὡς
εμοι γενοιτο χειρα Νεοβουλης θιγειν</ins>. It is clear
that women had a prominent place in the
poetry of Stesichorus, and in his poem entitled
<i>Calyce</i> we seem to have had an anticipation of
the modern love romance. And yet, in spite of
all this, we are informed that the Greeks had no
love-poetry addressed to, or concerning women,
before Anacreon.</p>

<p>The methods adopted for minimizing or disguising
the importance of women in the <i>Iliad</i>
and <i>Odyssey</i> are very amusing. "The Trojan
war was the work of a woman; but how very
little that woman appears in the <i>Iliad</i>." She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288" href="#Page_288">[288]</a></span>
appears quite as frequently and imposingly as
the action admits, and she and Andromache are
painted as elaborately as any of the <i>dramatis
personæ</i> in the poem. Indeed, it would not be
too much to say that, with the exception of
Achilles and Agamemnon, they leave the deepest
impression on us. "A woman has been managing
the affairs of Odysseus for twenty years in an
exemplary fashion; but the hero of the <i>Odyssey</i>
on his return prefers to associate with the swineherd."
Comment is superfluous. Nothing could
be more striking than the prominence which is
given to women both in the <i>Iliad</i> and in the
<i>Odyssey</i>. To cite such writers as Simonides of
Amorgus, Phocylides and Theognis, as authorities
on the position of women, is as absurd, in Sancho
Panza's phrase, as to look for pears on an elm.</p>

<p>The Greek Tragedies are treated after the
same fashion as the <i>Iliad</i> and the <i>Odyssey</i>. We
are told that the remarkable prominence given
in Sophocles's plays to the affection between
brother and sister affords conclusive proof that
the nature of modern love between man and
woman was unknown to him; and we are also
informed, that the relations between Electra and
Orestes, and Antigone and Polynices "are absolutely
those of modern lovers." It would be
difficult to say which is more absurd, the deduction
or the statement. What love could be
more loyal and more passionate than Hæmon's
love for Antigone? The prominence given by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289" href="#Page_289">[289]</a></span>
Sophocles to the love between brother and sister
has its origin from the same cause as the very
small part played by lovers in the Greek tragedies
generally. In the first place, a poet who
took his plot from the fortunes of the houses
of Pelops or Laius could only work within the
limits of tradition; in the second place, love
romances, unless involving deep tragical issues
as in the <i>Trachiniæ</i>, the <i>Medea</i>, and the <i>Hippolytus</i>,
were totally incompatible with the Greek
idea of tragedy. But we must hurry to the grand
discovery made by the author of this volume.</p>

<p>Somewhere about 405 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> flourished Antimachus,
of Colophon, the author of a voluminous
epic, and of several other poems. He
had the misfortune to lose his wife Lyde, and, to
beguile his sorrow, he composed a long elegy in
her honour. Of the far-reaching consequences
of this act let our author speak. "When Antimachus
first sat down in his empty house at
Colophon to write an elegy to his dead wife,
consciously or unconsciously he was initiating
the greatest artistic revolution that the world
has ever seen." Asclepiades and Philetas followed
him as imitators, and the thing was done.
Woman was at last "connected with 'romance.'"
Our author admits the difficulty of supposing
that "any one man could invent and popularize
an entirely new emotion"; but suggests that if
we regard it as "simply due to the readjustment
of an already existing emotion," that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290" href="#Page_290">[290]</a></span>
<ins title="paiderastia">παιδεραστια</ins>, such a supposition is "no longer
absurd." It is not only absurd but monstrous.</p>

<p>The truth almost certainly is, that the love
between man and woman in ancient Greece differed
very little from the love between man and
woman as it exists now. Marriage was, it is
true, purely a matter of business; most wives
aspired to nothing more than the management
of the nursery and the household, and most
women being without education, and living in
seclusion, could scarcely associate, intellectually
at least, on equal terms with their husbands or
lovers. But this proves nothing more than
<i>mariages de convenance</i>, and love based on the
fascination exercised by sensuous attraction
prove now. Then, as in our own time, there
were marriages and marriages, liaisons and liaisons.
The story which Plutarch tells of Callias
(<i>Cimon.</i> iv.) shows that marriage was often based
on love. The pictures given of Hector and Andromache
in the <i>Iliad</i>, of Alcinous and Arete, of
Ulysses and Penelope, of Menelaus and Helen in
the <i>Odyssey</i>, the charming account of Ischomachus
and his young wife in the <i>Œconomics</i>
of Xenophon, the noble and pathetic story of
Pantheia and Abradatas in the <i>Cyropædeia</i>,
the story which, in his life of Agis,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Plutarch
tells of Chilonis, and, in the <i>Morals</i>, of Camma,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
and innumerable other legends, traditions, and
anecdotes, prove that women could inspire and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291" href="#Page_291">[291]</a></span>
return as pure and as chivalrous a love as any
of the heroines of chivalry. The poet who could
write about marriage as Homer does in the
Sixth Odyssey would have had little to learn
from modern refinement.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> The love which
Critobulus describes himself as having for
Amandra, in the <i>Symposium</i> of Xenophon, and
the remarks made by Socrates in that dialogue
embody the most exalted conceptions of the
passion of love between the sexes. The sentiments
of Plutarch on this subject are indistinguishable
from the most refined notions of the
modern world, as is abundantly illustrated in
the <i>Amatorius</i>, the <i>Conjugalia Præcepta</i>, and in
the remarks on marriage in the eighth chapter
of the Essay on Moral Virtue. If Ajax and
Hercules became brutes, Tecmessa and Deianeira
were not the only women who have discovered
that men are, too often, May when they woo, and
December when they wed. It is ridiculous to
suppose that a people whose popular poetry
could present such types of womanhood as Arete,
Antigone, Alcestis, Deianeira, Electra, Macaria,
Iphigenia, Evadne, and Polyxena, who could
boast such poetesses as Sappho, Erinna, Corinna,
Myrtis, and Damophila, and whose society was
graced by such women as Aspasia, Diotima,
Gnathæna, Herpyllis, Metaneira, and Leontium,
should have given expression to passion, sentiment,
and romance only in <ins title="paidikoi
hymnoi">παιδικοι ὑμνοι</ins>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292" href="#Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>What the author of this book, and what others
who are fond of generalizing about the Greeks,
forget, is, that of a once vast and voluminous
literature we have only fragments. That portion
of their poetry which would have thrown light
on the subject here discussed has perished.
It is certain, for example, that of their lyric
poetry a very large portion was erotic, of that
portion exactly one poem has survived in its
entirety, while a few hundred scattered lines,
torn from their context, represent the rest that
has come down to us. We know, again, that in
some hundreds of their dramas, in the Middle
and New Comedy that is to say, the plots turned
on love—of these dramas not a single one is
preserved. But the reflection of some twenty
of them in Terence and Plautus, and several
scattered fragments, clearly indicate, that the
passion between the sexes involved as much
sentiment and romance as it does in our Elizabethan
dramatists. In what respect do Charinus
and Pamphilus in the <i>Andria</i> and Antipho in
the <i>Phormio</i>—mere replicas, of course, of Greek
originals—differ from modern lovers? What
could be more romantic than the love story
which formed the plot of the <i>Phasma</i> of Menander?
It is fair to our author to say that he
fully admits this, in the only tolerably satisfactory

owing to that rage for scandalous tittle-tattle,
so unhappily characteristic of ancient anecdote-mongers
from Ion to Athenæus.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_43_43" id="Footnote_43_43"></a><a href="#FNanchor_43_43"><span class="label">[43]</span></a> <i>Poems.</i> By Stephen Phillips. London and New York
John Lane.</p></div>


<p>The accent here is unmistakable, it is the
accent of a new and a true poet. Mr.
Phillips gives us no mere variations on familiar
melodies, no clever copies of classical archetypes,
and what is more, he has not employed any
illegitimate means of attracting attention and
giving distinction to his work. An audacious
choice of subjects, the adoption of the stones
which the builders have rejected, and, it may be
added, disdained, has, when coupled with elaborate
affectations and eccentricities of treatment
and style, often enabled mediocrity to pass, temporarily
at least, for genius, and the specious
counterfeit of originality for the thing itself.
But these poems are marked by simplicity, sincerity,
spontaneity. If a discordant note is
sometimes struck, here in an over-strained conceit,
and there in an incongruous touch of preciosity
or false sentiment, this is but an accident;
in essentials all is genuine. Nature and passion
affect to be speaking, and nature and passion
really speak. A poet, of whom this may be said
with truth, has passed the line which divides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295" href="#Page_295">[295]</a></span>
talent from genius, the true singer from the
accomplished artist or imitator. He has taken
his place, wherever that place may be, among
authentic poets. To that high honour the present
volume undoubtedly entitles Mr. Phillips.
It would now, perhaps, be premature to say more
than "Ingens omen habet magni clarique triumphi,"
but we may predict with confidence that,
if fate is kind and his muse is true to him, he
has a distinguished future before him. It may
be safely said that no poet has made his <i>début</i>
with a volume which is at once of such extraordinary
merit and so rich in promise.</p>

<p>Mr. Phillips is not a poet who has "one plain
passage of few notes." He strikes many chords,
and strikes them often with thrilling power. The
awful story narrated in <i>The Wife</i> is conceived and
embodied with really Dantesque intensity and
vividness; it has the master's suggestive reservation,
smiting phrase, and clairvoyant picture
wording, as "in the red shawl <i>sacredly</i> she
burned," "smiled at him with her lips, not with
her eyes"; while "Mother and child that food
together ate" is, in pregnancy of tragic suggestiveness,
almost worthy to stand with the "poscia,
più che il dolor, poté il digiuno." Equally distinguished,
though on another plane of interest,
is <i>The woman with the dead Soul</i>, the soul which
could once "wonder, laugh, and weep," but over
which the days began to fall "dismally, as rain
on ocean blear," till—<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296" href="#Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i2">"Existence lean, in sky dead grey</div>
<div class="i0">Withholding steadily, starved it away."</div></div></div>

<p>If the pathos in these poems is almost "too deep
for tears," it is gentler in the second and third
of the lyrics, which are as exquisite as they
are affecting. The idea in the lines <i>To Milton
Blind</i>, is worthy of Milton's own sublime conceit,
that the darkness which had fallen on his eyes
was but the shadow of God's protecting wings.
The whole poem, indeed, is a beautiful paraphrase
of the noble passage in the <i>Second Defence
of the People of England</i>: "For the Divine law"—we
give it in the English translation—"not
only shields me from injury, but almost renders
me too sacred to attack, not indeed so much from
the privation of my sight as from the overshadowing
of those heavenly wings which seem
to have occasioned this obscurity; and which,
when occasioned, he is wont to illuminate with
an interior light more precious and more pure."</p>

<p>In <i>The Lily</i>, which is a little obscure—a fault
against which Mr. Phillips would do well to
guard, for he frequently offends in this respect—we
have the note of Petrarch, but Petrarch
would not have ended the poem so flatly.
Tennyson is recalled, too nearly perhaps, in "By
the Sea," but it is a poem of great charm and
beauty. <i>The New De Profundis</i> is, unhappily,
the key to Mr. Phillips' characteristic mood; it
reminds us of the curse imposed on the worldling
in Browning's <i>Easter Day</i>, before he has learned
the use of life and doubt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297" href="#Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Phillips' two most ambitious poems are
<i>Christ in Hades</i> and <i>Marpessa</i>. In <i>Christ in
Hades</i> he fails, as Mrs. Browning failed in <i>The
Drama of Exile</i>. He attempts a theme—a stupendous
theme—to which his genius is not equal,
and which could only have been adequately
treated by such poets as Dante and Milton, in the
maturity of their powers. It has neither basis
nor superstructure. It is what the Greeks would
call "meteoric" as distinguished from "sublime."
It is a weird, wild, and chaotic dream; and yet
for all this its appeal to the heart and the imagination
is piercing and direct. Like Tennyson,
Mr. Phillips has the art of unfolding the full
significance of a few suggestive words in a great
classic; and nothing could be more effective than
the use to which he has applied the famous lines
which Homer places in the mouth of Achilles.
Poetry has few things more pathetic than
Homer's picture of Hades and the dead, and that
pathos Mr. Phillips has given us in quintessence,
as few would question after reading the lines
which describe Persephone yearning for her
return to the spring-illumined world, the speech
of the Athenian ghost, and the woman's address
to Christ. If the world depicted has something
of Horace's artistic monster, or, to change the
image, something of the anarchy of dreams in
its composition, the vividness and picturesqueness
with which particular figures and scenes are
flashed into light and definition is extraordinarily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298" href="#Page_298">[298]</a></span>
impressive. It is so with the central figure,
Christ; it is so with Prometheus; and the contrast
between these martyrs for man has both
pathos and grandeur.</p>

<p>There is more originality, more power in
<i>Christ in Hades</i> than in <i>Marpessa</i>, but <i>Marpessa</i>
has more balance, more sanity, more
of the stuff out of which good and abiding
poetry is made, than its predecessor. The one
savours of the spasmodic school, the productions
of which have rarely been found to have the
principle of life, however rich they may have
been in promise; the other is a return to a
school in which most of those who have gained
permanent fame have studied. And we are
glad to find a young poet there.</p>

<p>But it would be doing Mr. Phillips great injustice
not to note that, though he has had many
predecessors in the semi-classical, semi-romantic
re-treatment of the Greek myths, notably Keats
in <i>Hyperion</i>, Wordsworth in <i>Dion</i> and <i>Laodamia</i>,
Landor in his <i>Hellenics</i>, and Tennyson in <i>Ænone</i>
and <i>Tithonus</i>, he has treated his theme with
a distinction which is all his own, and has
impressed on it an intense individuality. In
comparison with these masters he may be
<i>pauper</i>, but he is <i>pauper in suo ære</i>.</p>

<p>It would be easy to point to faults in Mr.
Phillips' work. His sense of rhythm, even allowing
for what are plainly deliberate experiments
in discord, seems often curiously defective. How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299" href="#Page_299">[299]</a></span>
stiff and limping, for example, is the following:—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i10">"O pity us,</div>
<div class="i0">For I would ask of thee only to look</div>
<div class="i0">Upon the wonderful sunlight and to smell</div>
<div class="i0">Earth in the rain. Is not the labourer</div>
<div class="i0">Returning heavy through the August sheaves</div>
<div class="i0">Against the setting sun, who gladly smells</div>
<div class="i0">His supper from the opening door—is he</div>
<div class="i0">Not happier than these melancholy kings?</div>
<div class="i0">How good it is to live, even at the worst!</div>
<div class="i0">God was so lavish to us once, but here</div>
<div class="i0">He hath repented, jealous of His beams."</div></div></div>

<p>Lines, again, like "Pierced her, and odour full of
arrows was," "Realizes all the uncoloured dawn,"
"Yet followed a riddled memorable flag," are,
no doubt, extreme instances, but they are typical
of many bad lines. Occasionally he falls flat on
some harsh prosaic phrase, like "beautiful indolence
<i>was on our brains</i>." Nor is he always
happy in his attempts at novelty in phraseology,
as in his employment of the words "liable,"
"inaccurate," "pungent"; and these faults in
rhythm and diction are the more remarkable, as
the really subtle mastery over rhythmic expression
which he exhibits at times, and his singularly
felicitous epithets, turns, and phrases are
among his most striking gifts. Take a few out
of very many: "A bleak magnificence of endless
hope," "That common trivial face, of endless
needs," "The mystic river, floating wan," "And
the moist evening fallow, richly dark," "That
palest rose sweet on the night of life." How noble
is the rhythm and imagery of the following:—<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300" href="#Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i10">"All the dead</div>
<div class="i0">The melancholy attraction of Jesus felt:</div>
<div class="i0">And millions, like a sea, wave upon wave,</div>
<div class="i0">Heaved dreaming to that moonlight face, or ran</div>
<div class="i0">In wonderful long ripples, sorrow-charmed.</div>
<div class="i0">Toward him, in faded purple, pacing came</div>
<div class="i0">Dead emperors, and sad, unflattered kings;</div>
<div class="i0">Unlucky captains, listless armies led:</div>
<div class="i0">Poets with music frozen on their lips</div>
<div class="i0">Toward the pale brilliance sighed."</div></div></div>

<p>And it would be easy to multiply illustrations
from <i>Marpessa</i> and <i>By the Sea</i>. Occasionally
there is a certain incongruity between the form
and the matter. A poem so essentially, so
intensely realistic as <i>The Wife</i> should not have
such quaintnesses as "palèd in her thought."
Nor should we have</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"The constable, with lifted hand,</div>
<div class="i0">Conducting the orchestral Strand";</div></div></div>

<p>nor should a railway station be described as a
"moonèd terminus." Nothing is so disenchanting
as affectation.</p>

<p>One cannot but add that these poems, welcome
as they are, would have been more welcome still,
had they been less profoundly melancholy.
Their monotonous sadness, the persistency with
which they dwell on all those grim and melancholy
realities which poetry should help us to
forget, or cheer us in enduring, is not merely
their leading, but their pervading characteristic.
This note will, we hope, change. Leopardi is
immortal, and could not be spared; but one
Leopardi is enough for a single century.</p>

Illustrated with Portraits. By W. H. Kearley Wright,
F.R.H.S. London: Elliot Stock. 1896.</p></div>


<p>Some nineteen hundred years ago Horace
observed that there was one thing which
neither gods, nor men, nor bookstalls would tolerate
in a poet—and that was mediocrity. The
verdict of gods, men, and the bookstalls is probably
still what it was then; but to such tribunals
the rhymesters of our time can afford to be
quite indifferent. Paper and printing are cheap;
small poets and small critics are now so numerous
that they form a world, and a populous
world, in themselves; and, well understanding
the truth of the old proverb, "Concordiâ, parvæ
res crescunt," they mutually manufacture the
wreaths with which they crown each other's
modest vanity. There are hundreds of "poets"
and "critics" of whom the great world knows
nothing, who are thus enabled, in their little day,
to taste all the sweets of fame, and "walk with
inward glory crown'd." To wage serious war<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302" href="#Page_302">[302]</a></span>
against such a tribe as this would be as absurd
as to break butterflies upon a wheel; but
we really think it high time that some protest
should be made against the indefinite multiplication
of the rubbish for which these people and
their patrons are responsible, and still more
against its importation into what purports to be
a contribution to serious literature. As long as
these geniuses confine themselves to their proper
sphere, the poets' corners of provincial newspapers,
we have nothing to say. But it becomes
quite another matter when the skill of an ingenious
projector enables—we are really sorry to
have to speak so harshly—a rabble of poetasters
to figure side by side with poets of classical
fame, and to appear in all the dignity of contributors
to a national anthology. Yet such is
the design of this volume, which was, it seems,
published by subscription, the subscribers being
for the most part the various candidates for
poetical fame, who have obligingly sent their
portraits and their biographies for insertion in
Mr. Kearley Wright's "monumental work." As
Mr. Kearley Wright's collection begins with the
fifteenth century, and includes the really eminent
poets who happen to have been born in the
West of England, many of his worthies are
naturally <i>apud plures</i>, but the majority, in whose
honour the anthology appears to have been compiled,
adorn the living. And very gratifying it
must be for these gentlemen, and for Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303" href="#Page_303">[303]</a></span>
Kearley Wright himself—for he also has a
niche—to find themselves side by side with Sir
Walter Raleigh, Herrick, Gay, and Coleridge.</p>

<p>Mr. Kearley Wright's "company of makers"
is certainly a motley one. First comes among
his living bards an inspired porter at the Teignmouth
railway station, who asks in rapture,—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"Along the glitt'ring streets of gold,</div>
<div class="i1">Amid the brilliant glare,</div>
<div class="i0">Shall we God's banner there unfold,</div>
<div class="i1">His righteous helmet wear?"</div></div></div>

<p>At no great distance follows, with a portrait
looking intensely intellectual, "the manager of
the Bristol and South Wales Railway Waggon
Company, Limited," whose poems are described
as "lacking here and there logical sequence and
literary method," but "evincing undoubtedly
a great poetical disposition and philosophical
drift." The two poems which illustrate this
poet's genius afford very little proof either of
"a great poetical disposition" or of "a philosophical
drift," but painfully conclusive proof that
much more is lacking than "logical sequence and
literary method," the lack of which may certainly
be conceded as well. Next comes Mr. Jonas
Coaker, "the landlord of the Warren House Inn,"
whose verses "disclose a poetic spirit, and, had
he possessed the advantages of education, would
doubtless have attracted some attention." Mr.
Coaker is in the main autobiographical.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304" href="#Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"I drew my breath first on the moor,</div>
<div class="i1">There my forefathers dwelled;</div>
<div class="i0">Its hills and dales I've traversed o'er,</div>
<div class="i1">Its desert parts beheld.</div>
<div class="i1" style="letter-spacing:2em;">*****</div>
<div class="i0">It's oft envelop'd in a fog,</div>
<div class="i1">Because it's up so high."</div></div></div>

<p>And Mr. Coaker continues in the same strain
further than we care to transcribe. Then we
have Mr. John Goodwin, "formerly a coach-guard,
who sung of the days when there was
such a thing, if we may so phrase it, as the
poetry of locomotion." In his poetry, we are
told, "there is a genuine ring," as here, for
example:—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"I mind the time, when I was guard,</div>
<div class="i1">The lord, the duke, or squire</div>
<div class="i0">Would travel by the old stage-coach,</div>
<div class="i1">Or post-chaise they would hire."</div></div></div>

<p>Mr. Charles Chorley, who is, we are informed,
submanager of the Truro Savings Bank, in verses
which are presumably a parody of Sir William
Jones' <i>Imitation of Alcæus</i>, inquires, not without
a certain propriety, "What constitutes a mine?"
On a par with all these are the verses of the
bard who "in summer hawked gooseberries and
in winter shoelaces," and those of the "uneducated
journeyman woolcomber."</p>

<p>Now, we need hardly say that the humble
vocations of these poets are neither derogatory
to them nor in any way detrimental to merit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305" href="#Page_305">[305]</a></span>
where merit exists; but there is no merit whatever
in the poems assigned to them in this
volume; they are simply such poems as hawkers,
woolcombers, railway porters, and submanagers
of provincial banks—"who pen a stanza when
they should engross"—might be expected to
write. The same may be said of almost every
copy of verses, produced by amateurs, to be found
in this collection. We have scarcely noticed a
single poem which rises above mediocrity; a
very large proportion are below even a mediocre
standard—they are simply rubbish. In one poet
only, among those whose names were not before
known to us, do we discern genius, and that is
in Mr. John Dryden Hosken, whose poem, entitled
<i>My Masters</i>, is really excellent.</p>

<p>The editor of this anthology is plainly incompetent,
both in point of taste and critical discernment,
and in point of knowledge, for the task
which he has undertaken. The first is proved by
the extracts which he has selected from the works
of well-known poets. Coleridge, for example,
is represented by two comparatively inferior
poems, <i>The Devil's Thoughts</i> and <i>Fancy in Nubibus</i>;
Thomas Carew, by two short poems, one
of which is probably the worst he ever wrote;
Herrick, by two of his very worst; Praed, by two
of the feeblest and least characteristic of his
poems; Walcot, by mere trash. It is quite possible
that their less illustrious brethren may
have suffered from the deplorable inability of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306" href="#Page_306">[306]</a></span>
this editor to discern between what is good and
what is bad. Certainly Capern, who was a poet
with a touch of genius, suffers, for the lyric
given is very far indeed from representing or
illustrating his best or even his characteristic
work. In giving an account of Alexander Barclay,
who, by the way, is called Andrew in the
Preface, Mr. Wright says nothing about his
most important poems—his Eclogues. If Eustace
Budgell is included among the poets, why
are not his poems specified and represented?
Of Aaron Hill it is observed that "neither his
reputation as a poet nor his connexion with the
county of Devon is sufficient to warrant more
than a mere notice of his name." Aaron Hill
was the author of more than one poem of conspicuous
merit. The verses attributed on page
488 to Sir William Yonge were written by Lady
Mary Wortley Montagu. But these are trifles.
What we wish to protest against is the foisting
of such volumes as these on our libraries; and
it is appalling to learn that it is the intention of
Mr. Kearley Wright, if he is sufficiently encouraged
by subscribers, to follow this with another
similar collection. If poets like these wish to
gratify their vanity, let them not gratify it to
the detriment of serious literature; for, if the
few can discriminate, the many cannot, and the
multiplication of works like these must infallibly
tend to lower the standard of current literature,
by furthering the disastrous "cult of the average<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307" href="#Page_307">[307]</a></span>
man." In our opinion criticism can have no
more imperative duty than to discountenance
and discourage in every way such projectors as
Mr. Kearley Wright and such poets as those for
whose merits he and critics like him stand sponsors.</p>

Hexameter Verse by the Right Hon. Sir George Osborne
Morgan, Bart., Q.C., M.P. London.</p></div>


<p>Sir George Osborne Morgan has
served his generation in much more important
capacities than those of a scholar and a
translator of Virgil, and had this little work,
therefore, been less meritorious than it is, no
critic with a sense of the becoming would deal
harshly with it. But it challenges and deserves
serious consideration, not only as an attempt to
solve a problem of singular interest to students
of classical poetry, but as a somewhat ambitious
contribution to the literature of translation.
Sir Osborne Morgan is, however, mistaken in
supposing that in translating Virgil into his
own metre he "has undertaken a task which
has never been attempted before." In 1583
Richard Stanihurst published a translation of
the first four books of the <i>Æneid</i> in English
hexameters; and, if Sir Osborne will turn to
Webbe's <i>Discourse of English Poetrie</i>, published
as early as 1586, he will find versions in English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309" href="#Page_309">[309]</a></span>
hexameters of the First and Second Eclogues,
while Abraham Fraunce, in a curious volume,
entitled <i>The Countess of Pembroke's Ivy Church</i>,
which appeared in 1591, has, among the other
hexameters in the collection, given a version of
the Second Eclogue in this measure. But Sir
Osborne Morgan has been more immediately
anticipated in his experiment. In 1838 Dr.
James Blundell published anonymously, under
the title of <i>Hexametrical Experiments</i>, versions
in hexameters of the First, Fourth, Sixth, and
Tenth Eclogues, and to this translation he prefixed
an elaborate preface, vindicating the employment
of the hexameter in English, and explaining
its mechanism to the unlearned. Indeed,
Blundell arrived at the same conclusion as Sir
Osborne Morgan, that the proper medium for an
English translation of hexametrical poems in
Greek and Latin is the English hexameter. We
may, however, hasten to add that Sir Osborne
has little to fear from a comparison with his
predecessors, who have, indeed, done their best
to refute by example their own theory. It may
be observed, in passing, that the translations of
Virgil into rhymed decasyllabic verse are far
more numerous than Sir Osborne Morgan seems
to suppose. He is, he says, acquainted only
with two—the version by Dryden and Joseph
Warton—not seeming to be aware that Warton
translated only the <i>Georgics</i> and <i>Eclogues</i>,
printing Pitt's version of the <i>Æneid</i>. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310" href="#Page_310">[310]</a></span>
whole of Virgil was translated into this
measure by John Ogilvie between 1649-50, and
by the Earl of Lauderdale about 1716, while
versions of the <i>Æneid</i>, the <i>Georgics</i>, and the
<i>Eclogues</i>, in the same metre, have abounded in
every era of our literature, from Gawain
Douglas's translation of the <i>Æneid</i> printed in
1553, to Archdeacon Wrangham's version of the
<i>Eclogues</i> in 1830.</p>

<p>It is no reproach to Sir Osborne Morgan that,
in the occupations of a busy political life, his
scholarship should have become a little rusty,
but it is a pity that he should so often have
allowed himself to be caught tripping, when a
little timely counsel in the correction of his
proof sheets might have prevented this. In
the First Eclogue the line</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"Non insueta graves temptabunt pabula fetas"</div></div></div>

<p>is translated</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"Here no unwonted herb shall tempt the travailing cattle."</div></div></div>

<p>What it really means is, no change of fodder,
no fodder which is strange to them, shall
"infect" or "try" the pregnant cattle,
"insueta" being used in exactly the same sense
as in Eclogue V. 56, "<i>insuetum</i> miratur limen
Olympi," and "temptare" as it is used in Georg.
III. 441, and commonly in classical Latin. It is,
to say the least, questionable whether in the
couplet—<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311" href="#Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"Pauperis et tuguri congestum cæspite culmen,</div>
<div class="i0">Post aliquot, mea regna videns, mirabor aristas?"—</div></div></div>

<p>the last line can mean</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"Gaze on the straggling corn, the remains of what once was my kingdom."</div></div></div>

<p>"Aristas" is much more likely to be a metonymy
for "messes," <i>i.e.</i> "annos," like <ins title="arotou">αροτου</ins> in
Sophocles' <i>Trachiniæ</i>, 69, <ins title="ton

αροτον</ins>, a confirmative illustration which seems
to have escaped the commentators; but it is
difficult to say, and Sir Osborne has, it must be
owned, excellent authority for his interpretation.
In Eclogue III. the somewhat difficult
passage</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i8">"pocula ponam</div>
<div class="i0">Fagina....</div>
<div class="i0">Lenta quibus torno facili superaddita vitis</div>
<div class="i0">Diffusos hedera vestit pallente corymbos"—</div></div></div>

<p><i>i.e.</i> "where the limber vine wreathed round
them by the deft graving tool is twined with
pale ivy's spreading clusters,"—is translated:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"Over whose side the vine by a touch of the graving tool added</div>
<div class="i0">Mantles its clustering grapes in the paler leaves of the ivy."</div></div></div>

<p>This is quite wrong. "Corymbos" cannot possibly
mean clusters of grapes, but clusters of ivy
berries, "hederâ pallente" being substituted,
after Virgil's manner, for "hederæ pallentis."
In Eclogue IV. 24 there is no reason for
supposing that the "fallax herba veneni" is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312" href="#Page_312">[312]</a></span>
hemlock; it is much more likely to be aconite.
In line 45 "sandyx" should be translated not
"purple" but "crimson," vague as the colour
indicated by "purple" is. In Eclogue V.</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i4">"Si quos aut Phyllidis ignes,</div>
<div class="i0">Aut Alconis habes laudes, aut jurgia Codri"</div></div></div>

<p>is not</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"Phyllis's fiery loves you would sing or the quarrels of Codrus,"</div></div></div>

<p>but "your passion for Phyllis, your invectives
against Codrus," "ignes" being used far more
becomingly for a man's love than for a woman's.
So, again, "pro purpureo narcisso" cannot
mean what nature never saw, "purple daffodil,"
but the white narcissus. In Eclogue VIII.
"Sophocleo tua carmina digna cothurno" is
turned by what is obviously a <i>lapsus calami</i>,
"worthy of Sophocles' sock." A scholar like
Sir Osborne Morgan does not need reminding
that the "sock" is a metonymy for Comedy, as
Milton anglicizes it in <i>L'Allegro</i>, "if Jonson's
learned sock be on." In the exquisite passage
in Eclogue VIII. 41—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"Jam fragiles poteram ab terrâ contingere ramos"—</div></div></div>

<p>to translate "fragiles" as "frail" is to miss the
whole point of the epithet. What Virgil means
is, "I could just reach the branches from the
ground and <i>break them off</i>"; if it is to be translated
by one epithet, it must be "brittle."
Again in the Ninth Eclogue the words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313" href="#Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i6">"quâ se subducere colles</div>
<div class="i0"><i>Incipiunt</i>, mollique jugum demittere clivo,"</div></div></div>

<p>do not mean "where the hills with gentle
depression steal away into the plain," but the
very opposite: <i>i.e.</i> "Where the hills begin to
draw themselves up from the plain," the ascent
being contemplated from below. In Eclogue
IX., in turning the couplet</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"Nam neque adhuc Vario videor, nec dicere Cinnâ</div>
<div class="i0">Digna, sed argutos inter strepere anser olores,"</div></div></div>

<p>the translator has no authority for turning the
last verse into "a cackling goose in a chorus of
cygnets," for there is no tradition that cygnets
sang, and goose should have been printed with a
capital letter to preserve the pun, the allusion
being to a poetaster named Anser. Unfortunately
for the English translator, our literature
can boast no counterpart to "Anser" <i>totidem
literis</i>, but Goose printed with a capital is near
enough to preserve, or suggest the sarcasm.
There is another slip in Eclogue X.: "Ferulas"
is not "wands of willow" but "fennel."</p>

<p>Occasionally a touch is introduced which is
neither authorized by the original, nor true to
nature. There is nothing, for instance to
warrant, in Eclogue I. 56, the epithet "odorous"
as applied to the willow, nor does "salictum"
mean a "willow" but a "willow-bed or plantation."
To translate "ubi tempus erit" by
"when the hour shall have struck" reminds
us of Shakespeare's famous anachronism in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314" href="#Page_314">[314]</a></span>
<i>Julius Cæsar</i> and is as surprising in the work
of a scholar as the lengthening of the penultimate
in arbutus, "Sweet is the shower to the
blade, To the newly weaned kid the arbutus."
As a rule, the translator turns difficult passages
very skilfully, but this is not the case with
the couplet which concludes the "Pollio":—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"Incipe, parve puer: cui non risere parentes</div>
<div class="i0">Nec deus hunc mensâ, dea nec dignata cubili est";</div></div></div>

<p>that is, the "babe on whom the parent never
smiled, no god ever deemed worthy of his board,
no goddess of her bed"—in other words, he can
never enjoy the rewards of a hero like Hercules;
but there is neither sense nor skill, and
something very like a serious grammatical
error, in</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i4">"Who knows not the smile of a parent,</div>
<div class="i0">Neither the board of a god nor the bed of a goddess is worthy."</div></div></div>

<p>But to turn from comparative trifles. No
one who reads this version of the <i>Eclogues</i> can
doubt that Sir Osborne Morgan has proved his
point, that the English hexameter, when skilfully
used, is the measure best adapted for
reproducing Virgil's music in English. The
following passage (<i>Ec.</i> VII. 45-48) is happily
turned; let us place the original beside the
translation:—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"Muscosi fontes et somno mollior herba,</div>
<div class="i0">Et quæ vos rarâ viridis tegit arbutus umbrâ,</div>
<div class="i0">Solstitium pecori defendite: jam venit æstas</div>
<div class="i0">Torrida, jam læto turgent in palmite gemmæ."</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315" href="#Page_315">[315]</a></span>
</div></div>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"Moss-grown fountains and sward more soft than the softest of slumbers,</div>
<div class="i0">Arbutus tree that flings over both its flickering shadows,</div>
<div class="i0">Shelter my flock from the sun. Already the summer is on us,</div>
<div class="i0">Summer that scorches up all! See the bud on the glad vine is swelling."</div></div></div>

<p>Again (<i>Ec.</i> X. 41-48):—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"Serta mihi Phyllis legeret, cantaret Amyntas:</div>
<div class="i0">Hic gelidi fontes, hic mollia prata, Lycori,</div>
<div class="i0">Hic nemus: hic ipso tecum consumerer ævo.</div>
<div class="i0">Nunc insanus amor duri me Martis in armis</div>
<div class="i0">Tela inter media atque adversos detinet hostes:</div>
<div class="i0">Tu procul a patriâ—nec sit mihi credere tantum!—</div>
<div class="i0">Alpinas, ah dura, nives et frigora Rheni</div>
<div class="i0">Me sine sola vides."</div></div></div>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"Phyllis would gather me flowers and Amyntas a melody chant me;</div>
<div class="i0">Cool is the fountain's wave and soft is the meadow, Lycoris;</div>
<div class="i0">Shady the grove! Here with thee I would die of old age in the greenwood.</div>
<div class="i0">Mad is the lust of war, that now in the heart of the battle</div>
<div class="i0">Chains me where darts fall fast, and the charge of the foemen is fiercest,</div>
<div class="i0">Far, far away from your home—Oh, would that I might not believe it—</div>
<div class="i0">Lost amid Alpine snows or the frozen desolate Rhineland,</div>
<div class="i0">Lonely without me you wander."</div></div></div>

<p>Many other felicitous passages might be
quoted; indeed, there is no Eclogue without
them; but the translator is not sure-footed,
and, if he occasionally illustrates the hexameter
in its excellence, he illustrates, unhappily too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316" href="#Page_316">[316]</a></span>
often, some of its worst defects. Two qualities
are indispensable to the success of this measure
in English. Our language, unlike the classical
languages, being accentual and not quantitative,
if the long syllable is not represented where the
stress naturally falls, and the short syllables
where it does not fall, the effect is sometimes
grotesque, sometimes distressing, and always
unsatisfactory. Nothing, for example, could
be worse in their various ways than the
following:—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"Wept when you saw they were given the lad, and had you not managed."</div>
<br />
<div class="i0">"Let not the frozen air harm you."</div>
<br />
<div class="i0">"Scatter the sand with his hind hoofs."</div>
<br />
<div class="i0">"The pliant growth of the osier."</div>
<br />
<div class="i0">"Worthy of Sophocles' sock, trumpet-tongued through the Universe echo."</div>
<br />
<div class="i0">"Own'd it himself, and yet he would not deliver it to me."</div></div></div>

<p>A very nice ear, too, is required to adjust the
collocation of words in which either vowels or
consonants predominate, and the relative position
of monosyllabic and polysyllabic words,
the predominance of the former in our
language increasing enormously the difficulty.
No measure, moreover, so easily runs into
intolerable monotony—a monotony which
Clough sought to avoid by overweighting his
verses with spondees, and which Longfellow
illustrates by the cloying predominance of the
dactylic movement. Sir Osborne Morgan tells
us that he took Kingsley as his model.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317" href="#Page_317">[317]</a></span>
Kingsley's hexameters are respectable, but they
have no distinction, and he had certainly not a
good ear. Longfellow's are far better, and are
sometimes exquisitely felicitous, as in a couplet
like the following, which, with the exception of
one word, is flawless:—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"Men whose lives glided on like the rivers that water the woodlands,</div>
<div class="i0">Darken'd by shadows of earth, but reflecting an image of Heaven."</div></div></div>

<p>Probably the best hexameters which have been
composed in English are those in William
Watson's <i>Hymn to the Sea</i> and those in which
Hawtry translated Iliad III. 234-244, and the
parting of Hector and Andromache in the
Sixth Iliad, models—these versions—not merely
of translation, but of hexametrical structure.
There are, however, certain magical effects,
particularly in the Virgilian hexameter, produced
by an exquisite but audacious tact in
the employment of licences, which can never
be reproduced in English.</p>

<p>Such would be—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"Nam neque Parnassi vobis juga, nam neque Pindi</div>
<div class="i0">Ulla moram fecere, neque Aonie Aganippe.</div>
<div class="i0">Illum etiam lauri, etiam flevere myricæ;</div>
<div class="i0">Pinifer illum etiam solâ sub rupe jacentem</div>
<div class="i0">Mænalus et gelidi fleverunt saxa Lycæi."</div></div></div>

<p>Milton, and Milton alone among Englishmen,
had the secret of this music, but he elicited
it from another instrument.</p>

Edition, with Memoir and Critical Appendices, by the Rev.
D. C. Tovey. 2 vols. London.</p></div>


<p>"Jacob Thomson, ein vergessener Dichter
des achtzehnten Jahrhunderts"—a forgotten
poet of the eighteenth century—such is
the title of a recent monograph on the author
of <i>The Seasons</i> by Dr. G. Schmeding. Dr. G.
Schmeding is, however, so obliging as to pronounce
that, in his opinion, this ought not to be
Thomson's fate; that there remains in his work,
especially in <i>The Seasons</i> merit enough to
entitle him to be "enrolled among poets," and
to find appreciation, at all events in schools and
reading societies. Dr. Schmeding may rest
assured that Thomson's fame is quite safe. It
has no doubt suffered, as that of all the poets
of the eighteenth century has suffered, by the
great revolution which has, in the course of the
last ninety years, passed over literary tastes and
fashions. But during the present century there
have been no less than twenty editions of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319" href="#Page_319">[319]</a></span>
poems, to say nothing of separate editions of <i>The
Seasons</i>; while his works, or portions of them,
have been translated into German, Italian, modern
Greek, and Russian. Only two years ago M. Léon
Morel, in his <i>J. Thomson, sa vie et ses œuvres</i>, published
an elaborate and admirable monograph
on this "forgotten poet." And now Mr. Tovey,
who, we are glad to see, has been appointed
Clarke Lecturer at Cambridge, has given us a
new biography of him and a new edition of his
works, making, if we are not mistaken, the thirty-second
memoir of him and the twenty-first
edition of his works which have appeared since
the beginning of the century. This is pretty
well for a forgotten poet!</p>

<p>Mr. Tovey's name is a sufficient guarantee for
accurate and scholarly work. But it might
naturally be asked, what is there to justify another
edition of this poet, when so many editions
are already in the field and so easily accessible?
We have little difficulty in answering this question.
The special features of Mr. Tovey's edition
are as important as they are interesting. In the
first place, he has given us a much fuller biography
than has hitherto appeared in English;
in the second place, he has thrown much interesting
light on the political bearing of Thomson's
dramas; and, in the third place, he has given,
what no other editor of Thomson has given, a
full collation of Thomson's own MS. corrections,
preserved in Mitford's copy, now deposited in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320" href="#Page_320">[320]</a></span>
British Museum. The critical notes have cost
him, he says, and we can quite believe it, much
time and labour, and in his preface he half apologizes
for what may seem "a ridiculous travesty
of more important labours." There was no
necessity for such an apology: he observes justly
that he has "not spent more pains on Thomson's
text than so many of our scholars bestow upon
some Greek and Latin poets whose intrinsic
merit is no greater than Thomson's."</p>

<p>To serious readers these critical notes will
constitute the most valuable part of Mr. Tovey's
labours; they are, in truth, the speciality of this
particular edition, and will make it indispensable
to all students of this most interesting
poet. And now Mr. Tovey will, we trust, forgive
us if, with due deference, we point out
what seem to us to be defects in his work.
The first thing that might have been expected
from so learned and careful an editor of
Thomson was an adequate discussion of the
great problem of the authorship of <i>Rule Britannia</i>,
and the second an exposure of one of
the most extraordinary "mare's-nests" to be
found in English literature. But nothing, we
regret to say, can be more perfunctory and
inadequate than the two notes in which the
first question is hurried over with references
to <i>Notes and Queries</i>, and nothing more irritating
than the confusion worse confounded
in which Mr. Tovey leaves the second. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321" href="#Page_321">[321]</a></span>
shall therefore make no apology for entering
somewhat at length into <a name="Correct14" id="Correct14">both these questions.</a></p>

<p>And first for the authorship of <i>Rule Britannia</i>.
The facts are these. In 1740 Thomson and
Mallet wrote, in conjunction, a masque entitled
<i>Alfred</i>, which, on 1st August in that year, was
represented before the Prince and Princess of
Wales at Clifden. It was in two acts, and
it contained six lyrics, the last being <i>Rule
Britannia</i>, which is entitled an "Ode," the
music being by Dr. Arne. In 1745 Arne turned
the piece into an opera, and also into "a
musical drama." By this time the lyric had
become very popular, but there is no evidence
to show that it had been definitely attributed to
either of the coadjutors. In 1748 Thomson died.
In 1751 Mallet re-issued <i>Alfred</i>, but in another
form. It was entirely remodelled, and almost
entirely re-written, and, in an advertisement prefixed
to the work, he says: "According to the
present arrangement of the fable I was obliged
to reject a great deal of what I had written in
the other: neither could I retain, of my friend's
part, more than three or four speeches, and a part
of one song." Now, of the parts retained from
the former work, there were the first three
stanzas of <i>Rule Britannia</i>, the three others being
excised, and their place supplied by three stanzas
written by Lord Bolingbroke. If Mallet is to be
believed, then, "part of one song" must refer,
either to a song in the third scene of the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322" href="#Page_322">[322]</a></span>
act, beginning "From those eternal regions
bright," or to <i>Rule Britannia</i>, for these are the
only lyrics in which portions of the lyrics in the
former edition are retained. <i>Rule Britannia</i> is,
it is true, entitled "An Ode" in the former edition,
and the other lyric "A Song," so that Mallet
would certainly seem to imply that what he
had retained of his friend's work was the portion
of the song referred to, and not <i>Rule Britannia</i>.
But, as Mallet was notoriously a man who could
not be believed on oath, and was an adept in
all those bad arts by which little men filch honours
which do not belong to them, if he is to be
allowed to have any title to the honour of composing
this lyric, it ought to rest on something
better than the ambiguity between the word
"Ode" and the word "Song."</p>

<p>There is no evidence that, while both were
alive, either Thomson or Mallet claimed the
authorship; but this is certain, it was printed at
Edinburgh, during Mallet's lifetime, in the second
edition of a well-known song book, entitled <i>The
Charmer</i>, with Thomson's initials appended to
it. It is certain that Mallet had friends in
Edinburgh, and it is equally certain that neither
he nor any of his friends raised any objection to
its ascription to Thomson. In 1743, in 1759, and
in 1762 Mallet published collections of poems,
but in none of these collections does he lay claim
to <i>Rule Britannia</i>, and, though it was printed in
song-books in 1749, 1750, and 1761, it is in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323" href="#Page_323">[323]</a></span>
no case assigned to Mallet. None of his contemporaries,
so far as we know, attributed it to
him, and it is remarkable that, in a brief obituary
notice of him which appeared in the <i>Scots
Magazine</i> in 1765, he is spoken of as the author
of the famous ballad <i>William and Margaret</i>, but
not a word is said about <i>Rule Britannia</i>. A
further presumption in Thomson's favour is this:
in all probability Dr. Arne, who set it to music,
knew the authorship, and he survived both
Thomson and Mallet, dying in 1778. The song
had become very popular and celebrated, so that
if Mallet had desired to have the credit of
its composition, it is strange that he should
not have laid claim to it, had his claim been
a good one. But if his claim was not good,
he could hardly have ventured to claim the
authorship, as Dr. Arne would have been in his
way. It is quite possible that the ambiguity in
the advertisement to the recension of 1751 was
designed; it certainly left the question open,
and we cannot but think there is something
very suspicious in what follows the sentence in
Mallet's advertisement, where he speaks of his
having used so little of his friend's work. "I
mention this expressly," he adds, "that, whatever
faults are found in the present performance,
they may be charged, as they ought to be,
entirely to my account." A vainer and more
unscrupulous man than Mallet never existed;
and, while it is simply incredible that he should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324" href="#Page_324">[324]</a></span>
not have claimed what would have constituted
his chief title to popularity as a poet, had he
been able to do so, it is in exact accordance with
his established character that he should, as he
did in the advertisement of 1751, have left himself
an opportunity of asserting that claim, should
those who were privy to the secret have predeceased
him, and thus enabled him to do so
with impunity.</p>

<p>The internal evidence—and on this alone the
question must now be argued—seems to us conclusive
in Thomson's favour. The Ode is simply
a translation into lyrics of what finds embodiment
in Thomson's <i>Britannia</i>, in the fourth
and fifth parts of <i>Liberty</i>, and in his Verses to
the Prince of Wales. Coming to details, there
can be no doubt that the third stanza—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"Still more majestic shalt thou rise,</div>
<div class="i1">More dreadful from each foreign stroke;</div>
<div class="i0">As the loud blast that tears the skies</div>
<div class="i1">Serves but to root thy native oak"—</div></div></div>

<p>was suggested by Horace's</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"Duris ut ilex tonsa bipennibus</div>
<div class="i0">Nigræ feraci frondis in Algido,</div>
<div class="i1">Per damna, per cædes, ab ipso</div>
<div class="i2">Ducit opes animumque ferro."</div></div></div>

<p>Now, not only was Horace, as innumerable
imitations and reminiscences prove, one of
Thomson's favourite poets, but Thomson has, in
the third part of <i>Liberty</i> translated this very
passage:—<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325" href="#Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i10">"Like an oak,</div>
<div class="i0">Nurs'd on feracious Algidum, whose boughs</div>
<div class="i0">Still stronger shoot beneath the rigid axe</div>
<div class="i0">By loss, by slaughter, from the steel itself</div>
<div class="i0">E'en force and spirit drew."</div></div></div>

<p>He has, elsewhere, two other reminiscences of
the same passage, once in the third part of
<i>Liberty</i>—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i6">"Every tempest sung</div>
<div class="i0">Innoxious by, or bade it firmer stand"—</div></div></div>

<p>and once in <i>Sophonisba</i> (Act V. sc. ii.):—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i11">"Thy rooted worth</div>
<div class="i0">Has stood these wintry blasts, grown stronger by them."</div></div></div>

<p>The epithet "azure" employed in the first
stanza is, with "cerulean" and "aerial," one of
the three commonest epithets in Thomson, the
three occurring at least twenty times in his
poetry. A somewhat cursory examination of
his works has enabled us to find that "azure" or
"azured" alone occurs ten times. "Generous,"
too, in the Latin sense of the term, is another
of his favourite words, it being used no less
than sixteen times in <i>Britannia</i> and <i>Liberty</i>
alone. Another of his favourite allusions is to
England's "native oaks." Thus in <i>Britannia</i>
he speaks of—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i3">"Your oaks, peculiar harden'd, shoot</div>
<div class="i0">Strong into sturdy growth;"</div></div></div>

<p>in the last part of <i>Liberty</i> we find "Let her own
naval oak be basely torn," and in the same part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326" href="#Page_326">[326]</a></span>
of the poem he speaks of the "venerable oaks"
and "kindred floods." The epithet "manly" and
the phrase "the fair"—"manly hearts to guard
the fair"—are also peculiarly Thomsonian, being
repeatedly employed by him, the phrase "the
fair" occurring in his poetry at least six times,
if not oftener. "Flame," too, is another of his
favourite words.</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"All their attempts to bend thee down</div>
<div class="i0">Will but arouse," etc.,</div></div></div>

<p>is exactly the sentiment in <i>Britannia</i>.</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i10">"Your hearts</div>
<div class="i0">Swell with a sudden courage, growing still</div>
<div class="i0">As danger grows."</div></div></div>

<p>The stanza beginning "To thee belongs," etc., is
simply a lyrical paraphrase of the passage in
<i>Britannia</i> commencing "Oh first of human
blessings," and of a couplet in the last part of
<i>Liberty</i>:—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"The winds and seas are <a name="Correct15" id="Correct15">Britain's wide domain;</a></div>
<div class="i0">And not a sail but by permission spreads."</div></div></div>

<p>The couplet</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"All thine shall be the subject main,</div>
<div class="i0">And every shore it circles thine"</div></div></div>

<p>is simply the echo of a couplet in the fifth part
of <i>Liberty</i>—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"All ocean is her own, and every land</div>
<div class="i0">To whom her ruling thunder ocean bears."</div></div></div>

<p>The phrase "blessed isle," as applied to England,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327" href="#Page_327">[327]</a></span>
he employs three times in <i>Liberty</i>. Again,
the stanza in which <i>Rule Britannia</i> is written
is the stanza in which the majority of Thomson's
minor lyrics are written, and the rhythm and
cadence, not less than the tone, colour and
sentiment, are exactly his.</p>

<p>Mallet was undoubtedly an accomplished man
and a respectable poet, as his ballad <i>William
and Margaret</i>, his <i>Edwin and Emma</i>, and his
<i>Birks of Invermay</i> sufficiently prove, but he has
written nothing tolerable in the vein of <i>Rule
Britannia</i>. Neatness, and tenderness bordering
on effeminacy, mark his characteristic lyrics, and,
if we except a few lines in his <i>Tyburn</i> and
the eight concluding lines in a poem entitled
<i>A Fragment</i>, there is no virility in his poetry
at all. Of the patriotism and ardent love of
liberty which pervade Thomson's poems, and
which glow so intensely in <i>Rule Britannia</i>, he
has absolutely nothing. Nor are there any
analogues or parallels in his poems to this lyric
either in form—for if we are not mistaken, he
has never employed the stanza in which it is
written—or in imagery, or phraseology. Like
Thomson, whom, in his narrative blank-verse
poems, he servilely imitates, he is fond of the
words "azure" and "aerial"; and the word
"azure" is the only verbal coincidence linking
the phraseology of his acknowledged poems
with the lyric in question. It may be added,
too, that a man who was capable of the jingling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328" href="#Page_328">[328]</a></span>
rubbish of such a masque as <i>Britannia</i>, and
who had the execrable taste to substitute Bolingbroke's
stanzas for the stanzas which they supersede,
could hardly have been equal to the production
of this lyric. We believe, then, that there
can be no reasonable doubt that the honour of
composing <i>Rule Britannia</i> belongs to Thomson
the bard, and not to Mallet the fribble.</p>

<p>But to return to Mr. Tovey and the "mare's-nest"
to which we have referred. This mare's-nest
is the assumption that Pope assisted
Thomson in revising <i>The Seasons</i>. Since Robert
Bell's edition this has come to be received as an
established fact, but we propose to show that
it rests on a hypothesis demonstrably baseless.</p>

<p>There is, in the British Museum, an interleaved
copy of the first volume of the London edition
of Thomson's works, dated 1738, and the part of
the volume which contains <i>The Seasons</i> is
full of manuscript deletions, corrections, and
additions. These are in two handwritings, the one
being unmistakably the handwriting of Thomson,
the other beyond all question the handwriting
of some one else. Almost all these corrections
were inserted in the edition prepared for
the press in 1744, and now, consequently, form
part of the present text. The corrections in the
hand which is not the hand of Thomson are, in
many cases, of extraordinary merit, showing a
fineness of ear and delicacy of touch quite above
the reach of Thomson himself. We will give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329" href="#Page_329">[329]</a></span>
two or three samples. Thomson had written
in <i>Autumn</i> 290 seqq.:—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"With harvest shining all these fields are thine,</div>
<div class="i0">And if my rustics may presume so far,</div>
<div class="i0">Their master, too, who then indeed were blest</div>
<div class="i0">To make the daughter of Acasto so."</div></div></div>

<p>The unknown corrector substitutes the present
reading:—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"The fields, the master, all, my fair, are thine;</div>
<div class="i0">If to the various blessings which thy house</div>
<div class="i0">Has lavished on me thou wilt add that bliss,</div>
<div class="i0">That dearest bliss, the power of blessing thee!"</div></div></div>

<p>The other is famous. Thomson had written:—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"Thoughtless of beauty, she was beauty's self,</div>
<div class="i0">Recluse among the woods, if City-dames</div>
<div class="i0">Will deign their faith. And thus she went compell'd</div>
<div class="i0">By strong necessity, with as serene</div>
<div class="i0">And pleased a look as patience can put on,</div>
<div class="i0">To glean Palemon's fields."</div></div></div>

<p>For these vapid and dissonant verses is substituted
by the corrector, who very properly
retains the first verse, what is now the text:—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"Recluse amid the close embow'ring woods,</div>
<div class="i0">As in the hollow breast of Apennine,</div>
<div class="i0">Beneath the shelter of encircling hills,</div>
<div class="i0">A myrtle rises, far from human eyes,</div>
<div class="i0">And breathes its balmy fragrance o'er the wild.</div>
<div class="i0">So flourished blooming, and unseen by all,</div>
<div class="i0">The sweet Lavinia," etc.</div></div></div>

<p>The transformation of a single line is often most
felicitous: thus in <i>Winter</i> the flat line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330" href="#Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"Through the lone night that bids the waves arise"</div></div></div>

<p>is grandly altered into</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"Through the black night that sits immense around."</div></div></div>

<p>Thus, in <i>Spring</i>, Thomson had merely written</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"Whose aged oaks and venerable gloom</div>
<div class="i0">Invite the noisy rooks;"</div></div></div>

<p>but his corrector alters and extends the passage
into</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">"Whose aged elms and venerable oaks</div>
<div class="i0">Invite the rooks, who high amid the boughs</div>
<div class="i0">In early spring their airy city build,</div>
<div class="i0">And caw with ceaseless clamour."</div></div></div>

<p>Indeed, throughout <i>The Seasons</i> Thomson's
indebtedness to his corrector is incalculable;
many of the most felicitous touches are due to
him. Now, who was this corrector? Let Mr.
Tovey answer. "It has long been accepted as a
fact among scholars that Pope assisted Thomson
in the composition of <i>The Seasons</i>. Our original
authority is, we suppose, Warton." The truth is
that our original authority for this statement is
neither Warton nor any other writer of the
eighteenth century, but simply the conjecture of
Mitford—in other words, Mitford's mere assumption
that the handwriting of the corrector is the
handwriting of Pope; and, if we are not mistaken,—for
Mitford may have given earlier currency to
it in some other place—the conjecture appeared
for the first time in Mitford's edition of Gray,
published in 1814. In his copy of the volume,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331" href="#Page_331">[331]</a></span>
containing the MS. notes, he bolsters up his statement
by two assertions and references: "That
Pope saw some pieces of Thomson's in manuscript
is clear from a letter in Bowles's <i>Supplement</i>,
page 194" (an obvious misprint for 294). But
on turning to the references all that we find is—it
is in a letter dated February 1738/9—"I have
yet seen but three acts of Mr. Thomson's, but I
am told, and believe by what I have seen that
it excels in the pathetic"; the reference is
plainly to Thomson's tragedy, <i>Edward and Eleonora</i>.
Again, Mitford writes: "On Thomson's
submitting his poems to Pope" (see Warton's
edition, vol. viii., page 340), and again we get
no proof. All that Pope says is, "I am just
taken up"—he is writing to Aaron Hill under
date November 1732—"by Mr. Thomson in the
perusal of a new poem he has brought me;"
this new poem being almost certainly <i>Liberty</i>,
in the composition of which Thomson was then
engaged. So far from the tradition having
any countenance from Warton, it is as certain
as anything can be, that Warton knew nothing
about it. In his <i>Essay on Pope</i> he gives an
elaborate account of <i>The Seasons</i>, and he has
more than once referred to Pope and Thomson
together; but he says not a word, either in
this Essay or in his edition of Pope's Works,
about Pope having corrected Thomson's poetry.
If Pope assisted Thomson, to the extent indicated
in these corrections, such an incident,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332" href="#Page_332">[332]</a></span>
considering the fame of Thomson and the
fame of Pope, must have been known to
some at least of the innumerable editors, biographers,
and anecdotists between 1742 and
1814. It could hardly have escaped being recorded
by Murdoch, Mallet, or Warburton, by
Ruffhead, by Savage or Spence, by Theophilus
Cibber or Johnson. It is incredible that such
an interesting secret should have been kept
either by Thomson himself or by Pope. Again,
whoever the corrector was, he had a fine ear for
blank verse, and must indeed have been a master
of it. There is no proof that Pope ever wrote
in blank verse; indeed, we have the express
testimony of Lady Wortley Montagu that he
never attempted it, and his Shakespeare conclusively
proves that he had anything but a nice
ear for its rhythm. With all this collateral
evidence against the probability of the corrector
being Pope, we come to the evidence which
should settle the question, the evidence of handwriting.
There is no lack of material for forming
an opinion on this point. Pope's autograph
MSS. are abundant, illustrating his hand at every
period in his life. It is amazing to find Mitford
asserting that his friends Ellis and Combe, at the
British Museum, had no doubt about the hand
of the corrector being the hand of Pope. Mr.
Tovey candidly admits that, "if the best authorities
at the Museum many years ago were positive
that the handwriting was Pope's, their successors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333" href="#Page_333">[333]</a></span>
at the present time are equally positive that it
is not." Such is the very decided opinion of Mr.
Warner; such, also, as Mr. Tovey acknowledges,
is the opinion of Professor Courthope, and such,
we venture to think, will be the opinion of every
one who will take the trouble to compare the
hands. Mr. Tovey himself is plainly very
uneasy, and indeed goes so far as to say that "it
has all along been perplexing to me how the
opinion that this was Pope's handwriting could
ever have been <i>confidently</i>" (the italics are his)
"entertained"; and yet in his notes he follows
Bell, and inserts these corrections with Pope's
initials.</p>

<p>We search in vain among those who are
known to have been on friendly terms with
Thomson for a probable claimant. It could not,
as his other stupid revisions of Thomson's verses
sufficiently show, have been Lyttleton. Mallet's
blank verse is conclusive against his having had
any hand in the corrections. Collins and Hammond
are out of the question. It is just possible,
though hardly likely, that the corrector
was Armstrong. He was on very intimate
terms with Thomson. His own poem proves
that he could sometimes write excellent blank
verse, but the touch and rhythm of the corrections
are, it must be admitted, not the touch
and rhythm of Armstrong.</p>

<p>What has long, therefore, been represented
and circulated as an undisputed fact—namely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334" href="#Page_334">[334]</a></span>
that Pope assisted Thomson in the revision of
<i>The Seasons</i>—rests not, as all Thomson's
modern editors have supposed, on the traditions
of the eighteenth century, and on the testimony
of authenticated handwriting, but on a mere
assumption of Mitford. That the volume in
question really belonged to Thomson, and that
the corrections are originals, hardly admits of
doubt, though Mitford gives neither the pedigree
nor the history of this most interesting literary
relic. It is, of course, possible that the corrections
are Thomson's own, and that the differences in
the handwriting are attributable to the fact that
in some cases he was his own scribe, that in
others he employed an amanuensis; but the
intrinsic unlikeness of the corrections, made in
the strange hand, to his characteristic style
renders this improbable. In any case there
is nothing to warrant the assumption that the
corrector was Pope.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_47_47" id="Footnote_47_47"></a><a href="#FNanchor_47_47"><span class="label">[47]</span></a> <i>The Lesbia of Catullus.</i> Arranged and translated by
J. H. A. Tremenheere. London.</p></div>


<p>Perhaps the best thing in this world is
youth, and the poetry of Catullus is its
very incarnation. The "young Catullus" he was
to his contemporaries, and the young Catullus he
will be to the end of time. To turn over his
pages is to recall the days when all within and
all without conspire to make existence a perpetual
feast, when life's lord is pleasure, its end
enjoyment, its law impulse, before experience
and satiety have disillusioned and disgusted, and
we are still in Dante's phrase, "trattando l'ombre
come cosa salda." And the poet of youth had
the good fortune not to survive youth; of the
dregs and lees of the life he chose he had no
taste. While the cup which "but sparkles near
the brim" was still sparkling for him, death
dashed it from his lips. At thirty his tale was
told,—and a radiant figure, a sunny memory and
a golden volume were immortal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336" href="#Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>

<p>Revelling alike in the world of nature, and in
the world of man, at once simple and intense, at
once playful and pathetic, his poetry has a freshness
as of the morning, an abandon as of a child
at play. He has not, indeed, escaped the taint of
Alexandrinism any more than Burns escaped
the taint of the pseudo-classicism of the conventional
school of his day, but this is the only note
of falsetto discernible in what he has left us. It
is when we compare him with Horace, Propertius,
and Martial that his incomparable charm is most
felt. As a lyric poet, except when patriotic,
and when dealing with moral ideas, Horace is
as commonplace as he is insincere; he had no
passion; he had little pathos; he had not much
sentiment; he had no real feeling for nature,
he was little more than a consummate craftsman,
to adopt an expression from Scaliger "ex
alienis ingeniis poeta, ex suo tantum versificator."
In his Greek models he found not merely his form,
but his inspiration. Most of his love odes have
all the appearance of being mere studies in fancy.
When he attempts threnody he is as frigid as Cowley.
Whose heart was ever touched by the verses
to Virgil on the death of Quintilian, or by the
verses to Valgius on the death of his son? The
real Horace is the Horace of the Satires and
Epistles, and the real Horace had as little of
the temperament of a poet as La Fontaine and
Prior. Propertius had passion, and he had certainly
some feeling for nature, but he was an incurable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337" href="#Page_337">[337]</a></span>
pedant both in temper and in habit.
Martial applied the epigram, in elegiacs and in
hendecasyllabics, to the same purposes to which
it was applied by Catullus, with more brilliance
and finish, but he had not the power of informing
trifles with emotion and soul. What became
with Catullus the spontaneous expression of the
dominant mood, became in the hands of Martial
the mere <i>tour de force</i> of the ingenious wit.
Catullus is the most Greek of all the Roman
poets; Greek in the simplicity, chastity and propriety
of his style, in his exquisite responsiveness
to all that appeals to the senses and the emotions,
in his ardent and abounding vitality. But, in his
enthusiasm for nature, in the intensity of his
domestic affections, and in his occasional touches
of moral earnestness—and we have seldom to go
far for them—he was Roman. His sketches from
nature are delightful. What could be more
perfect than the following? Has even Tennyson
equalled it?—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">Hic, qualis flatu placidum mare matutino</div>
<div class="i0">Horrificans Zephyrus proclivas incitat undas,</div>
<div class="i0">Aurorâ exoriente, vagi sub lumina solis;</div>
<div class="i0">Quæ tarde primum clementi flamine pulsæ</div>
<div class="i0">Procedunt, leviterque sonant plangore cachinni:</div>
<div class="i0">Post, vento crescente, magis magis increbescunt,</div>

<blockquote><p>"As in early morning when Zephyr's breath, ruffling the
stilly sea, stirs it into slanting waves up against the glow of
the travelling sun; and at first, while the impelling breeze is
gentle, they move in slow procession, and the plash of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338" href="#Page_338">[338]</a></span>
ripples is not loud; but then, as the breeze freshens, they
crowd faster and faster on, and far out at sea, as they float,
flash back the splendour of the crimsoning day in their front."</p></blockquote>

<p>Or, again, in the epistle to Manlius—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">Qualis in aerii <i>pellucens</i> vertice montis</div>
<div class="i1">Rivus <i>muscoso prosilit e lapide</i>.</div></div></div>

and of early morning in the Attis, 39-41.</p>

<p>—who does not recognise Matthew Arnold's

<p>Flowers he loved, as Shakespeare loved them.
What tenderness there is in the image of the love

<div class="center"><div class="poem">

<p>—in the beautiful simile, so often imitated in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339" href="#Page_339">[339]</a></span>
every language in Europe, where the unmarried
maiden is compared to the uncropped flower, lxii.,
39-45; or where in the</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">

<p>he sees the symbol of maidenhood; or where
Ariadne is compared to the myrtles on the banks
of the Eurotas, and to the "flowers of diverse
hues which the spring breezes evoke"; and,
again, the exquisite simile picturing the husband's
love binding fast the bride's thoughts,
as a tree is entwined in the clinging clasp of
the gadding ivy—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">Mentem amore revinciens,</div>
<div class="i0">Ut tenax hedera huc et huc</div>
<div class="i3">Arborem implicat errans.</div></div></div>

<p>Then we have the garland of Priapus with its
felicitous epithets (xix., xx.).</p>

<p>It may be said of Catullus as Shelley said of
his Alastor—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i11">Every sight</div>
<div class="i0">And sound from the vast earth and ambient air</div>
<div class="i0">Sent to his heart their choicest impulses.</div></div></div>

<p>What rapture inspires and informs the lines to
his yacht, and to Sirmio, as well as the <i>Jam ver
egelidos refert tepores</i>!</p>

<p>As the author of the <i>Attis</i> Catullus stands
alone among poets. There was, so far as we
know, nothing like it before, and there has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340" href="#Page_340">[340]</a></span>
nothing like it since. If it be a study from the
Greek, as it is generally supposed to be, it is very
difficult to conjecture at what period its original
could have been produced. There is nothing at
all resembling it which has come down from the
lyric period; its theme is not one which would
have been likely to attract the Attic poets. If
its model was the work of some Alexandrian, we
can only say that such a poem must have been
an even greater anomaly in that literature than
Smart's <i>Song to David</i> is to our own literature, in
the eighteenth century. It may, of course, be
urged that it is equally anomalous in Latin
poetry, and that, if resolved into its elements, it
has much more affinity with what may be traced
to Greek than to Roman sources. In its compound
epithets, and more particularly in the
singular use of "foro," so plainly substituted for
the Greek <ins title="agora">αγορα</ins> and its associations, it certainly
reads like a translation from the Greek; and
yet, in the total impression made by it, the
poem has not the air of a translation, but of an
original, and of an original struck out, in inspiration,
at white heat.</p>

<p>Only by an extraordinary effort of imaginative
sympathy are we now able to realize to ourselves
the tragedy of the <i>Attis</i>, while its rushing galliambics
whirl us through the panorama of its swift-succeeding
pictures. But home to every heart
must come the poems which Catullus dedicates
to the memory of his brother, and the poem in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341" href="#Page_341">[341]</a></span>
which he tries to soothe Calvus for the death of
Quintilia.</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">Multas per gentes, et multa per aequora vectus</div>
<div class="i1">Advenio has miseras, frater, ad inferias,</div>
<div class="i0">Ut te postremo donarem munere mortis,</div>
<div class="i1">Et mutum nequidquam alloquerer cinerem:</div>
<div class="i0">Quandoquidem fortuna mihi tete abstulit ipsum:</div>
<div class="i1">Heu miser indigne frater adempte mihi!</div>
<div class="i0">Nunc tamen interea prisco quæ more parentum</div>
<div class="i1">Tradita sunt tristi munere ad inferias,</div>
<div class="i0">Accipe, fraterno multum manantia fletu:</div>
<div class="i1">Atque in perpetuum, frater, ave atque vale.</div></div></div>

<blockquote><p>"Many are the peoples, many the seas I have passed
through to be here, dear brother, at this, thine untimely
grave, that I might pay thee death's last tribute, and
greet,—how vainly,—the dust that has no response. For
well I know Fortune hath bereft me of thy living self—Ah!
hapless brother, cruelly torn from me! Yet here, see, be
the offerings which, from of old, the custom of our fathers
hath handed down as a sad oblation to the grave—take them—they
are streaming with a brother's tears. And now—for
evermore—brother, hail and farewell!"</p></blockquote>

<p>Could pathos go further? How exquisite, too,
is the following:—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">Si quidquam mutis gratum acceptumque sepulcris</div>
<div class="i1">Accidere a nostro, Calve, dolore potest,</div>
<div class="i0">Quum desiderio veteres renovamus amores,</div>
<div class="i1">Atque olim amissas flemus amicitias:</div>
<div class="i0">Certe non tanto mors immatura dolori est</div>
<div class="i1">Quintiliæ, quantum gaudet amore tuo.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342" href="#Page_342">[342]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>Shakespeare merely unfolded what was included
here, when he wrote those haunting lines:—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">When to the sessions of sweet silent thought</div>
<div class="i0">I summon up remembrance of things past,</div>
<div class="i0">I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,</div>
<div class="i0">And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste</div>
<div class="i0">Then can I drown an eye, unus'd to flow,</div>
<div class="i0">For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,</div>
<div class="i0">And weep afresh love's long-since cancell'd woe,</div>
<div class="i0">And moan the expense of many a vanish'd sight.</div></div></div>

<p>Never, too, has any poet given such pathetic
expression to a sorrow, which to the young is
even harder to bear than the loss inflicted by
death, the perfidy and treachery of friends. The
verses to Alphenus (xxx.), to the anonymous
friend in lxviii., and the epigram to Rufus (lxxvii.),
are indescribably touching. What infinite sadness
there is in:—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">Si tu oblitus es, at Dii meminerunt, meminit Fides,</div>
<div class="i0">Quæ te ut pæniteat postmodo facti faciet tui.</div></div></div>

<p>What passion of grief in:—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i2">Heu, heu, nostræ crudele venenum</div>
<div class="i0">Vitæ, heu, heu, nostræ pestis amicitiæ!</div></div></div>

<p>But nothing that Catullus has left us equals in
fascinating interest, or exceeds in charm, the
poems inspired by the woman who was at once
the bliss and the curse of his life—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">Lesbia nostra, Lesbia illa,</div>
<div class="i0">Illa Lesbia, quam Catullus unam</div>
<div class="i0">Plusquam se, atque suos amavit omnes.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343" href="#Page_343">[343]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>Whether she is to be identified with the sister
of P. Clodius Pulcher, and the wife of Metellus
Celer, seems to us, in spite of the arguments of
Schwaber, Munro, Ellis, and Sellar, extremely
doubtful. It is a point which need not be discussed
here, and is, indeed, of little importance.
That she was a woman of superb and commanding
beauty, a false wife, a false mistress, and of
immeasurable profligacy, Catullus has himself told
us. There could only be one end to a passion of
which such a siren was the object; and, exquisite
as the poems are which precede the breaking of the
spell, it is in the poems recording the gradual process
of disenchantment, and the struggle between
the old love and the new loathing, that Catullus
touches us most. How piercing is the pathos of
such a poem as the <i>Si qua recordanti</i> (lxxvi.), or
the epigram in which he says that he loves and
loathes, but knows not why, only knows that it is
so, and that he is on the rack:—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">Odi et amo. Quare id faciam, fortasse requiris.</div>
<div class="i1">Nescio: sed fieri sentio et excrucior.</div></div></div>

<p>Or where he says that, pest as she is, he cannot
curse a love who is dearer to him than both his
eyes:—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">Credis me potuisse meæ maledicere vitæ,</div>
<div class="i1">Ambobus mihi quæ carior est oculis?</div>
<div class="i0">Non potui, nec, si possem, tam perdite amarem.</div></div></div>

<p>And he suffered the more, as he had lavished
on her the purest affections of his heart. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344" href="#Page_344">[344]</a></span>
love for her—such was his own expression—was
not simply that which men ordinarily feel for
their mistresses, but such as the father feels for
his sons and his sons-in-law:—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">Dilexi tum te, non tantum ut vulgus amicam,</div>
<div class="i1">Sed pater ut gnatos diligit et generos.</div></div></div>

<p>But shameless as she is, and it is an impossibility
for her to be otherwise, he cannot abandon her.
Do what she will he is her slave. His mind, he
says, was so straitened by her frailty, so beggared
by its own devotion, that, even if she
became virtuous, he could not love her with
absolute goodwill, and if she stuck at nothing—drained
vice to its very dregs—he could not give
her up:—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">Huc est mens deducta tuâ, mea Lesbia, culpâ</div>
<div class="i1">Atque ita se officio perdidit ipsa suo,</div>
<div class="i0">Ut jam nec bene velle queam tibi, si optima fias,</div>
<div class="i1">Nec desistere amare, omnia si facias.</div></div></div>

<p>He compares himself to a man labouring under
a cruel and incurable disease, a disease which
is paralysing his energy, and draining life of its
joy:—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">Me miserum adspicite, et si vitam puriter egi,</div>
<div class="i1">Eripite hanc pestem perniciemque mihi,</div>
<div class="i0">Quæ mihi subrepens imos, ut torpor, in artus</div>
<div class="i1">Expulit ex omni pectore lætitias.</div></div></div>

<p>Nearly sixteen hundred years had to pass before
the world was to have any parallel to these
poems. And the parallel is certainly a remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345" href="#Page_345">[345]</a></span>
one. In the "Dark Lady" of Shakespeare's
Sonnets, Lesbia lives again; in the lover of the
dark lady, Lesbia's victim. Once more a false
wife and a false mistress, not indeed beautiful,
but with powers of fascination so irresistible
that deformity itself becomes a charm, makes
havoc of a poet's peace. Once more a passion,
as degraded as it is degrading, sows feuds
among friends, and "infects with jealousy the
sweetness of affiance." Once more rises the
bitter cry of a soul, conscious of the unspeakable
degradation of a thraldom which it is agony to
endure, and from which it would be agony to be
emancipated. Compare for instance:—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">My love is as a fever, longing still</div>
<div class="i0">For that which longer nurseth the disease,</div>
<div class="i0">Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,</div>
<div class="i0">The uncertain sickly appetite to please.</div>
<div class="i2" style="letter-spacing: 2em">&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;</div>
<div class="i0">Past cure I am, now reason is past care,</div>
<div class="i0">And frantic mad with evermore unrest,</div>
<div class="i0">My thoughts and my discourse as madman's are,</div>
<div class="i12">(Sonnet cxlvii.)</div></div></div>

<p>with Catullus, lxxvi.</p>

<p>And:—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill,</div>
<div class="i0">That in the very refuse of thy deeds</div>
<div class="i0">There is such strength and warrantise of skill,</div>
<div class="i0">That in my mind thy worst all best exceeds.</div>
<div class="i0">Who taught thee how to make me love thee more,</div>
<div class="i0">The more I hear and see just cause of hate?</div>
<div class="i12">(Sonnet cl.)</div></div></div>

<p>with Catullus, lxxii., lxxiii., lxxv.; while Sonnet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346" href="#Page_346">[346]</a></span>
cxxxvii. presents a ghastly parallel with Catullus,
lviii. Again, how exactly analogous is the adjuration
to Quintius in Epigram lxxxii., with
what finds expression in Sonnets xl.-xlii., and
Sonnet cxx. But it would be tedious as well as
superfluous to cite particular parallels where
the whole position—which may be summed up
in the two words of Catullus, "Odi et amo,"—is
identical.</p>

<p>Not the least remarkable thing about Catullus
is his range and his versatility. It is truly extraordinary
that the same pen should have given us
such finished social portraits as "Suffenus iste"
(xxii.), "Ad Furium" (xxiii.), "In Egnatium"
(xxxix.); the perfection of such serious fooling as
we find in the "Lugete, O Veneres" (iii.), and, if
we may apply such an expression to the most
delicious love poem ever written, the "Acme and
Septimius" (xlv.); of such humorous fooling
as we find in the "Varus me meus ad suos
amores" (x.), the "O Colonia quæ cupis" (xvii.),
the "Adeste, hendecasyllabi," the "Oramus, si
forte non molestum" (lv.); such epic as we
have in the "Peleus and Thetis"; such triumphs
of richness, splendour, and grace as we have in
the three marriage poems; such a superb expression
of the highest imaginative power, penetrated
with passion and enthusiasm, as we have
in the <i>Attis</i>; such concentrated invective and
satire as mark some of the lampoons; such
mock heroic as we have in the <i>Coma Berenices</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347" href="#Page_347">[347]</a></span>
such piercing pathos as penetrates the autobiographical
poems, and the poems dedicated to
Lesbia.</p>

<p>Catullus has been compared to Keats, but
the comparison is not a happy one. His
nearest analogy among modern poets is Burns.
Both were, in Tennyson's phrase, "dowered
with the love of love, the scorn of scorn,"
and, in the poems of both, those passions find
the intensest expression. Both had an exquisite
sympathy with all that appeals, either
in nature or in humanity, to the senses and
the affections. Both were sensualists and
libertines without being effeminate, or without
being either depraved or hardened. In both,
indeed, an infinite tenderness is perhaps the
predominating feature. Both had humour, that
of Catullus being the more caustic, that of
Burns the more genial. Both were distinguished
by sincerity and simplicity; both waged war
with charlatanry and baseness. Burns had the
richer nature and was the greater as a man;
Catullus was the more accomplished artist.</p>

<p>But it is time to turn to the book which has
recalled Catullus and Lesbia. Mr. Tremenheere
has, with great ingenuity, succeeded in concocting
by a process of elaborate dovetailing a very
pretty romance which he divides into nine
chapters, the first being "The Birth of Love,"
the second, third and fourth, "Possession,"
"Quarrels" and "Reconciliation," the fifth, sixth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348" href="#Page_348">[348]</a></span>
and seventh, "Doubt," "A Brother's Death" and
"Unfaithfulness," the last two, "Avoidance" and
"The Death of Love." The chief objection to
this is that it is for the most part fanciful, and
is absolutely without warrant, either from tradition
or from probability. Many of the poems
pressed into the service of his narrative by Mr.
Tremenheere have nothing whatever to do with
Lesbia. Such would be xiii., "The invitation to
Fabullus," xiv., "The Acme and Septimius."</p>

<p>The translations are very unequal. Of many
of them it may be said in Dogberry's phrase that
they "are tolerable and not to be endured," or to
borrow an expression from Byron "so middling
bad were better." Thus the powerful poem to
Gellius (xci.) is attenuated into:—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">'Twas not that I esteem'd you were</div>
<div class="i0">As constant or incapable</div>
<div class="i0">Of vulgar baseness, but that she</div>
<div class="i0">For whom great love was wasting me,</div>
<div class="i0">The spice of incest lacked for you;</div>
<div class="i0">And though we were old friends, 'tis true,</div>
<div class="i0">That seem'd poor cause to my poor mind,</div>
<div class="i0">Not so to yours.</div></div></div>

<p>Sometimes the versions are detestable. Nothing
could be worse than to turn:—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">Nulli illum pueri nullæ optavere puellæ</div></div></div>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">No more is she glad to the eyes of a lad,</div>
<div class="i2">To the lasses a pride,—</div></div></div>

<p>or</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">Dulcis pueri ebrios ocellos</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349" href="#Page_349">[349]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>as</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">Her minion's passion-sodden eyes,—</div></div></div>

<p>which might do very well for a coarse phrase like
"In Venerem putres," but not for "Ebrios." But
sometimes the renderings are very felicitous. As
here:—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">Quid vis? quâlubet esse notus optas</div>
<div class="i0">Eris: quandoquidem meos amores</div>
<div class="i0">Cum longâ voluisti amare pœnâ.</div></div></div>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">Cost what it may, you'll win renown!</div>
<div class="i0">You shall, such longing you exhibit</div>
<div class="i0">Both for my mistress—and a gibbet!</div></div></div>

<p>And the following is happy:—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">Nullum amans vere, sed identidem omnium</div>
<div class="i9">Ilia rumpens.</div>
<div class="i0">Nec meum respectet, ut ante, amorem</div>
<div class="i0">Qui illius culpâ cecidit; velut prati</div>
<div class="i0">Ultimi flos, prætereunte postquam</div>
<div class="i9">Tactus aratro est.</div></div></div>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">Ah, shameless, loveless lust, sweet, seek no more</div>
<div class="i0">To win love back, by thine own fault it fell,</div>
<div class="i0">In the far corner of the field though hid,</div>
<div class="i0">Touch'd by the plough at last,—the flower is dead.</div></div></div>

<p>The following also is neat and skilful, but how
inferior to the almost terrible impressiveness of
the original:—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">O Di si vostrûm est misereri, aut si quibus unquam</div>
<div class="i1">Extremâ jam ipsâ in morte tulistis opem.</div>
<div class="i0">Me miserum adspicite, et si vitam puriter egi,</div>
<div class="i1">Eripite hanc pestem perniciemque mihi,</div>
<div class="i0">Quæ mihi subrepens imos, ut torpor, in artus</div>
<div class="i1">Expulit ex omni pectore lætitias.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350" href="#Page_350">[350]</a></span>
</div></div>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">Oh God! if Thine be pity, and if Thou</div>
<div class="i0">E'en in the jaws of death ere now,</div>
<div class="i0">Hast wrought salvation—look on me;</div>
<div class="i0">And if my life seem fair to Thee</div>
<div class="i0">O tear this plague, this curse away,</div>
<div class="i0">Which gaining on me day by day,</div>
<div class="i0">A creeping slow paralysis,</div>
<div class="i0">Hath driven away all happiness.</div></div></div>

<p>Six love stories stand out conspicuous in the
records of poetry—those which find expression
in the <i>Elegies</i> of Propertius, in the <i>Sonnets and
Canzoni</i> of Dante and Petrarch, in the <i>Sonnets</i>
of Camoens, in the <i>Astrophel and Stella</i> of Sidney,
in the <i>Sonnets</i> of Shakespeare. But never
has passion, never has pathos, thrilled in intenser
or more piercing utterance than in the poems
which that fatal "Clytemnestra quadrantaria"—to
employ the phrase which may actually have
been applied to her—inspired, and in which the
rapture and loathing and despair of Catullus
found a voice.</p>

</a>THE RELIGION OF SHAKESPEARE<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></h2>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_49_49" id="Footnote_49_49"></a><a href="#FNanchor_49_49"><span class="label">[49]</span></a> <i>The Religion of Shakespeare.</i> Chiefly from the writings
of the late Mr. Richard Simpson. By Henry Sebastian
Bowden. London.</p></div>


<p>This book, which is partly a compilation
from the uncollected writings of the late
Richard Simpson and partly the composition of
Father Bowden himself, is an attempt to show
that Shakespeare was a Roman Catholic. It
contains much interesting information; it is
well written, and we have read it with pleasure.
With much which we find in it we entirely
concur and are in full sympathy. We take
Shakespeare quite as seriously as Father Bowden
does. We believe that the greatest of
dramatic poets is also one of the greatest of
moral teachers, that his theology and ethics
deserve the most careful study, and that they
have, too frequently, been either neglected or
misinterpreted. We agree with Father Bowden
that nothing could be sounder and more persistently
emphasised than the ethical element in
this poet's dramas; that his ethics are, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352" href="#Page_352">[352]</a></span>
main, the ethics of Christianity, and that so far
from Shakespeare being simply an agnostic and
having no religion at all, as Birch and others
have contended, he is, if not formally, at least in
essence, as religious as Æschylus and Sophocles.</p>

<p>And now Father Bowden must forgive us if
we are unable to go further with him. We
have no prejudice against Roman Catholicism,
or against any of the creeds in which religious
faith and reverence have found expression,—"Tros
Rutulusve fuat nullo discrimine agetur."
Our sole wish is, if possible, to get at the truth.
It is of comparatively little consequence now
to what form of religion Shakespeare belonged,
but it would be at least interesting, if it could
be shown that any particular sect could legitimately
claim him.</p>

<p>In discussing this question we must bear
in mind that in Shakespeare's time, as in
the time of the ancients, religion had two
aspects, its private and its public. In its public
aspect it was a part of the machinery of the
state, an essential portion of the political fabric.
Till the Reformation there had been practically
no schism and no difficulty. After the Reformation
a most perplexing problem presented itself.
Roman Catholicism and Protestantism, in
a long and terrible conflict, struggled for the
mastery. At the accession of Elizabeth the
victory had been won, so far as England was
concerned, by Protestantism, and Protestantism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353" href="#Page_353">[353]</a></span>
was the accepted religion of the nation. As
such, it was the duty of every loyal citizen to
uphold it; it became with the throne one of the
two pillars on which the fabric of the state
rested. Roman Catholicism became identified
with the political rivals and enemies of England.
Protestantism became identified with her lovers
and upholders. Thus the Church and the
Throne became indissoluble, at once the symbols,
centres, and securities of political harmony
and union. This accounts for the attitude of
Hooker, Spenser, Shakespeare and Bacon
towards Episcopalian Protestantism on the one
hand, and towards Puritanism on the other.
About Shakespeare's political opinions there
can be no doubt at all, for, if we except the
Comedies, he preaches them emphatically in
almost every drama which he has left us.
They were those of an uncompromising and
intolerant Royalist, in whose eyes the only
security for all that is dear to the patriot lay
in implicit obedience to the will of the sovereign,
and in upholding a system to which that will
was law. That he should, therefore, have had
any sympathy with the Roman Catholics is, on
<i>a priori</i> grounds, exceedingly improbable. We
turn to his Dramas, and what do we find? It
would be no exaggeration to say, that there is
not a line in them which indicates that he
regarded the Roman Catholics with favour.
On the contrary, they abound in points directed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354" href="#Page_354">[354]</a></span>
against them. Thus he twice goes out of his
way, once in <i>Henry V.</i><a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> and once in <i>All's Well
that Ends Well</i>, to observe that "miracles have
ceased." There is a bitter sneer at them in
the reference to the sanctimonious pirate and
the commandments, in <i>Measure for Measure</i>.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
There can be little doubt that the words in
the porter's speech in <i>Macbeth</i>, "here's an equivocator
that could swear in both the scales
against either scale, who committed treason
enough for God's sake, yet could not equivocate
to Heaven," have sarcastic reference to the
doctrine of equivocation avowed by Garnett and
popularly associated with the Jesuits; while
the remark about the fitness of "the nun's lip
to the friar's mouth"<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> in <i>All's Well that Ends
Well</i> is another concession to Protestant prejudice.</p>

<p>In <i>King John</i> such a speech as the following
may be dramatic, but who can doubt that it
expressed the poet's own sentiments?—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">Tell him this tale; and from the mouth of England</div>
<div class="i0">Add thus much more,—that no Italian priest</div>
<div class="i0">Shall tithe or toll in our dominions;</div>
<div class="i0">But, as we under Heaven are supreme head,</div>
<div class="i0">So, under Him, that great supremacy,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355" href="#Page_355">[355]</a></span>
</div></div>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">Where we do reign, we will alone uphold,</div>
<div class="i0">Without the assistance of a mortal hand:</div>
<div class="i0">So tell the Pope; all reverence set apart</div>
<div class="i0">To him, and his usurp'd authority.</div></div></div>

<p><i>King John</i> is, indeed, simply the manifesto of
Protestantism against papal aggression. What
could be more contemptible than the character
of Pandulph and the part which he plays? Is it
credible that Shakespeare could have had any
sympathy with a religion whose minister is one
whom he represents as saying:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">Meritorious shall that hand be called,</div>
<div class="i0">Canonized, and worshipped as a saint,</div>
<div class="i0">That takes away by any secret course</div>
<div class="i0">Thy hateful life.</div></div></div>

<p>In <i>Henry VIII.</i>, again, we have an elaborate
eulogy of the Reformation, Cranmer being presented
in the most favourable light, Gardiner
in the most unfavourable, while Wolsey is
almost as detestable as Pandulph.</p>

<p>It is really pitiable to see the shifts to which
the authors of this book are reduced to make
out their theory. They have even pressed into
its service Jordan's palpable and long-exploded
forgery of John Shakespeare's Will, and the
fact that John Shakespeare's name is found on
a list of Recusants, when it is, in that very list,
expressly stated that he had absented himself
from church, simply from fear of process for
debt. Passages in the dramas are similarly
perverted. Shakespeare's hostility to the Protestants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356" href="#Page_356">[356]</a></span>
induced him, we are told, to pour
contempt on Oldcastle by depicting him as Falstaff.
His delineation of Malvolio, and his
frequent sneers at the Puritans, are attributed
to the same motive. The famous lines in
<i>Hamlet</i>, placed in the mouth of the Ghost, are
cited to prove his belief in purgatory; the
comical penances imposed on Biron and his
friends in <i>Love's Labour Lost</i> to prove his
belief in penance. When in <i>Lear</i> it is said of
Cordelia that:—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i9">She shook</div>
<div class="i0">The holy water from her heavenly eyes.</div></div></div>

<p>we are to see another indication of Shakespeare's
religion as "they have a Catholic ring about
them." Sentiments which are common to all
sects of Christians are regarded as peculiar to
Roman Catholicism; mere dramatic utterances
are forced into illustrations of supposed personal
convictions. What is habitually and systematically
ignored is, that Shakespeare, being a
dramatic poet, must necessarily make his
characters express themselves dramatically, and
that, as he was depicting times preceding the
Reformation, his sentiments and expressions
very naturally took the colour of the world in
which his characters moved. The wonder is not
that this should have occurred, but that Shakespeare
should, in spite of the gross anachronism
of such a process, have so <i>Protestantized</i> pre-Reformation
times. We are quite willing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357" href="#Page_357">[357]</a></span>
concede to Father Bowden that there is enough
to warrant us in assuming that Shakespeare did
not regard the Puritans with favour. But his
dislike to them arose not from the fact that
they were Protestants, but that they were not
orthodox Protestants. He was opposed to
them for the same reasons that Elizabeth and
James, Hooker and Bacon were opposed to
them. Their hostility to his profession, their
sanctimonious cant, and the surly asceticism of
their lives, no doubt contributed to his prejudice
against them.</p>

<p>Nor are we in any way justified in concluding
that Shakespeare accepted the teaching of the
Church of Rome in spiritual matters. Nothing
could be more unwarranted than what is
assumed by Father Bowden in the following
passage. He is speaking of Shakespeare's attitude
in relation to death. "'Ripeness is all';
and he shows us in all his penitents how that
ripeness is secured, sin forgiven, and heaven
won on the lines of Catholic dogma and by the
Sacraments of the Church."</p>

<p>What are the facts? Shakespeare's reticence
about a future state, and what may await man,
in the form of reward and punishment hereafter,
is one of his most striking characteristics.
Neither Cordelia nor Desdemona, neither Constance
nor Imogen in their darkest hours
expresses any confidence in the final mercy and
justice of Heaven. Othello, falling by a fate as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358" href="#Page_358">[358]</a></span>
terrible as it was undeserved, dies without a
syllable of hope. "The rest is silence" are the
ominous words with which Hamlet takes leave
of life. When Gloucester believes himself to be
standing on the brink of death, in the farewell
which he takes of the world he has no anticipation
of any other; all he contemplates is "to
shake patiently his great affliction off." So die
Lear, Hotspur, Romeo, Antony, Eros, Enobarbus,
Macbeth, Beaufort, Mercutio, Laertes. So
die Brutus, Coriolanus, King John. In the
Duke's speech in <i>Measure for Measure</i>, where
he is preparing Claudio to meet death, death is
merely contemplated as an escape from the
pains and discomforts of life. Macbeth would
'jump' the world to come if he could escape
punishment in this. Prospero suggests no hope
of any waking from the "rounding sleep."
Even Isabella, dedicated as she was to religion,
in fortifying Claudio against his fate draws no
weapon from the armoury of faith. It is just
the same in the dirge in Cymbeline, in the
soliloquy of Posthumus, in the consolations
addressed by the gaoler to Posthumus.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359" href="#Page_359">[359]</a></span></p>

<p>The last passage is perhaps more remarkable
than any, because it shows the utter ambiguity
of the directest expression which the poet has
left on the subject.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Gaol.</i>—Look you, sir, you know not which way you go.</p>

<p><i>Post.</i>—Yes, indeed do I, fellow.</p>

<p><i>Gaol.</i>—Your death has eyes in 's head then; I have not
seen him so pictured: you must either be directed
by some that take upon them to know, or take
upon yourself, that which I am sure you do not
know; or jump the after inquiry on your own
peril; and how you shall speed in your journey's
end, I think you'll never return to tell one.</p>

<p><i>Post.</i>—I tell thee, fellow, <i>there are none want eyes to
direct them the way I am going, but such as
wink, and will not use them</i>.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Cymbeline</i>, V. 4.</p></blockquote>

<p>Shakespeare, in truth, never attempts to lift
the veil which for living man can be raised
only by Revelation. The silence of his philosophy,—for
we must not confound occasional
sentiments and mere dramatic utterances with
what justifies us in deducing that philosophy,—in
relation to a life after this, is unbroken.
It is, indeed, remarkable that he represents such
speculations,—the dwelling on such problems,—as
more likely to disturb, perplex, and hamper
us, than to give us any comfort. As Hamlet
puts it in the well-known lines:—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i2">The native hue of resolution</div>
<div class="i0">Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,</div>
<div class="i0">And enterprises of great pith and moment,</div>
<div class="i0">With this regard, their currents turn awry,</div>
<div class="i0">And lose the name of action.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360" href="#Page_360">[360]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>Did he believe in the immortality of the soul
and in a future state? Who can say? What
we can say is, that if we require affirmative
evidence of such a faith, we shall seek for it in
vain. In the Sonnets, where he seems to speak
from himself, the only immortality to which he
refers is the permanence of the impression which
his genius as a poet will leave—immortality in
the sense in which Cicero and Tacitus have so
eloquently interpreted the term. But on the
other hand, if there is nothing to warrant a
conclusion in the affirmative, there is nothing
to warrant one in the negative. His attitude is
precisely that of Aristotle in the <i>Ethics</i>; a life
beyond this is neither affirmed nor denied, but
the scale of probability inclines towards the
negative, and his moral philosophy proceeds
on the assumption that life is the end of life.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>Goethe has said that man was not born to
solve the problems of the universe, but to attempt
to solve them, that he might keep within
the limits of the knowable. And it is within
the limits of the knowable that Shakespeare's
theology confines itself. Starting simply, as
Gervinus says, from the point, that man is born
with powers and faculties which he is to use,
and with powers of self-regulation and self-determination
which are to direct aright the
powers of action, the "Whence we are," and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361" href="#Page_361">[361]</a></span>
the "Whither we are going," are problems for
which he has no solution.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i10">Men must endure</div>
<div class="i0">Their going hence e'en as their coming hither:</div>
<div class="i0">Ripeness is all.</div></div></div>

<p>And for ripeness or unripeness, man's will is responsible.
He would probably have agreed with
the saying of Heraclitus, <ins title="êthos
anthrôpô daimôn">ηθος ανθρωπω δαιμων</ins>.
Throughout his Dramas all is explicable, with
the single exception of Macbeth, without reference
to supernaturalism. Perfectly intelligible
effects follow perfectly intelligible causes; the
moral law solves all. But especially conspicuous
is the absence of the theological element
where we should especially have looked for it.
"Men and women," says Brewer, "are made to
drain the cup of misery to the dregs; but, as from
the depths into which they have fallen, by their
own weakness, or by the weakness of others, the
poet never raises them, in violation of the inexorable
laws of nature, so neither does he put a new
song in their mouths, or any expression of confidence
in God's righteous dealing. With as hard
and precise a hand as Bacon does he sunder the
celestial from the terrestrial kingdom, the things
of earth from the things of heaven."<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>His theology, indeed, in its application to life,
seems to resolve itself into the recognition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362" href="#Page_362">[362]</a></span>
universal law, divinely appointed, immutable,
inexorable, ubiquitous, controlling the physical
world, controlling the moral world, vindicating
itself in the smallest facts of life, and in the
most stupendous convulsions of nature and
society. In morals it is maintained by the observance
of the mean on the one hand, and the
due fulfilment of duty and obligation on the
other. In politics it is maintained by the subordination
of the individual to the state, and of
the state to the higher law. Hooker says of
Law, that as her voice is the harmony of the
world, so her seat is the bosom of God. The
Law Shakespeare recognises; of the Law-giver
he is silent. As he is dumb before the mystery
of death, so is he equally reticent in the face of
that other mystery. He has nothing of the
anthropomorphism of the Old Testament, of
the Homeric poems, and of Milton. Nor has he
ever expressed himself as Goethe has done in
the famous passage in <i>Faust</i>, beginning: "Wer
darf ihn nennen." In two important respects he
seems to differ from the Christian conception.
He represents no miraculous interpositions of
Providence, no suspension of natural laws in
favour of the righteous, and to the detriment of
the wicked. He is too reverend to say with
Goethe, that man, so far as direction in action
goes, is practically his own divinity. But he
does say and represent—and that repeatedly—what
is expressed in such passages as these:—<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363" href="#Page_363">[363]</a></span></p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie</div>
<div class="i0">Which we ascribe to Heaven: the fated sky</div>
<div class="i0">Gives us full scope.</div>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">

<div class="i9"><i>Troilus and Cressida.</i></div></div></div>

<p>And we have no right to expect that Providence
will cancel it. If deeds do not go with
prayer, prayer is not likely to be of much avail.
So the Bishop of Carlisle in <i>Richard II.</i>:—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">The means that Heaven yields must be embrac'd</div>
<div class="i0">And not neglected; else if Heaven would</div>
<div class="i0">And we will not, Heav'n's offer we refuse:—</div></div></div>

<p>while the words which he puts into the mouth
of Leonine in <i>Pericles</i> are, we feel, significant:—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i2">Pray: but be not tedious,</div>
<div class="i0">For the Gods are quick of ear, and I am sworn</div>
<div class="i0">To do my work with haste.</div>
</div></div>

<p>He has no sympathy with pious recluses. He
has depicted no saint or religious enthusiast, or
written a line to indicate that he had any
respect for their ideals. With him,—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">Spirits are not finely touched</div>
<div class="i0">But to fine issues.</div></div></div>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">They say best men are moulded out of faults,</div>
<div class="i0">And, for the most, become much more the better</div>
<div class="i0">For being a little bad.</div></div></div>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">Most subject is the fattest soil to weeds</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364" href="#Page_364">[364]</a></span></div></div>

<p>are typical axioms in his philosophy of life. And
the nearest approaches he has given us to the
saintly type of character are the sentimental
pietists, Henry VI. and Richard II., both of whom
are failures, and border closely on moral imbecility.
On the spiritual and moral efficacy of
faith, he has nowhere laid stress. In his innumerable
reflections on life and man, in his maxims
and precepts, there is, as a rule, scarcely any
flavour of Christian theology. They are just
such as might be expected from a pure rationalist.
Such is the philosophy of Hamlet, of Jacques, of
the Duke in <i>Measure for Measure</i>, and of Prospero.
Even Friar Laurence, though an ecclesiastic,
reasons and advises just as a Stoic philosopher
might have done. The friars in <i>Much Ado about
Nothing</i>, and in <i>Measure for Measure</i>, the Bishop
of Carlisle in <i>Richard II.</i>, and the Archbishops
of Canterbury and York in <i>Henry IV.</i> and <i>Henry
V.</i>, and Cardinal Beaufort in <i>Henry VI.</i>, act and
speak like mere men of the world. A bulky
volume would scarcely sum up the ethical and
political reflections scattered up and down his
plays; a few pages would comprise all that could
be put down as exclusively theological. This
complete subordination of the theological element
to the ethical is the more conspicuous
when we compare his dramas with the Homeric
Epics, and with the tragedies of Æschylus and
Sophocles.</p>

<p>And yet if a thoughtful person, after going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365" href="#Page_365">[365]</a></span>
attentively through the thirty-six plays, were
asked what the prevailing impression made on
him was, he would probably reply the profound
reverence which Shakespeare shows universally
for religion—his deep sense of the mysterious
relation which exists between God and man.
We feel that his silence on transcendental subjects
springs not from indifference, but from
awe. The remarkable words which he places
in the mouth of Lafeu, in <i>All's Well that Ends
Well</i> (Act II. 3), merely sum up what we hear
<i>sotto voce</i> in various forms of expression throughout
his dramas; "we have our philosophical
persons, to make modern and familiar, things
supernatural and causeless. Hence it is that
we make trifles of terrors, ensconcing ourselves
into seeming knowledge, when we should submit
ourselves to an unknown fear." And the same
reverence and humility find a voice in the verses
in which, in all probability, he took leave of the
world of active life.</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">Now my charms are all overthrown,</div>
<div class="i0">And what strength I have's mine own,</div>
<div class="i0">Which is most faint.</div>
<div class="i6">... Now I want</div>
<div class="i0">Spirits to enforce, art to enchant,</div>
<div class="i0">And my ending is despair</div>
<div class="i0">Unless I be relieved by prayer,</div>
<div class="i0">Which pierces so that it assaults</div>
<div class="i0">Mercy itself, and frees all faults.</div></div></div>

<p>No poet has dwelt more on the duty and moral
efficacy of prayer, on the omnipresence of God,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366" href="#Page_366">[366]</a></span>
and on the fact that in conscience we have a
Divine monitor.</p>

<p>Of the respect which Shakespeare entertained
for Christianity as a creed, of his conviction of
its competency to fulfil and satisfy all the ends
of religion in men of the highest type of intelligence
and ability, we require no further proof
than his Henry V. Henry V. is undoubtedly his
ideal man, as Theseus in the <i>Œdipus Coloneus</i>
is the ideal man of Sophocles. And Henry V.
is pre-eminently a Christian. Wherever Shakespeare
refers to the person and to the teachings
of Christ, it is always with peculiar tenderness
and solemnity. His ethics are in one respect
essentially Christian, and that is in their emphatic
insistence on the virtues of mercy and
forgiveness of injuries. In <i>Measure for Measure</i>,
he stretched the first as far as the Master Himself
stretched it, at the eleventh hour, to the
penitent thief. And in the <i>Tempest</i>, that play
which seems to embody in allegory Shakespeare's
mature and final philosophy of life,
who does not recognise the symbol of Him
who rules, not merely in justice and righteousness,
but in benevolence and mercy, when
Prospero, with sinners and traitors and foes
in his power, proclaims—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i6">The rarer action is</div>
<div class="i0">In virtue than in vengeance: they being penitent,</div>
<div class="i0">The sole drift of my purpose doth extend</div>
<div class="i0">Not a frown further.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367" href="#Page_367">[367]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>He struck this note in one of the earliest of
his plays:—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">Who by repentance is not satisfied,</div>
<div class="i0">Is nor of heaven, nor earth: for these are pleas'd.</div>
<div class="i0">By penitence th' Eternal's wrath's appeas'd.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></div></div></div>

<p>and the note vibrates through his works. It is
the crowning moral of <i>Measure for Measure</i>; it
is one of the dominant notes in <i>Cymbeline</i>. He
also reflects Christianity in the beautiful optimism
which discerns in evil the agent of good, and
in calamity and sorrow the benevolence and
mercy of God. This is the philosophy which
penetrates what were probably his last three
dramas, <i>The Winter's Tale</i>, <i>Cymbeline</i>, and <i>The
Tempest</i>.</p>

<p>In these respects, then, it may fairly be maintained
that Shakespeare is Christian. For the
rest his dramas might, so far as their philosophy
is concerned, have come down to us from
classical antiquity. Nothing can be more Greek
than the main basis on which his ethics rest—the
observance of the mean, and the recognition
of the relation of virtue to the becoming.
When Claudio says:—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">As surfeit is the father of much fast,</div>
<div class="i0">So every scope by the immoderate use</div>
<div class="i0">Turns to restraint;</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368" href="#Page_368">[368]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>when Norfolk says:—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">The fire that mounts the liquor till 't o'erflow</div>
<div class="i0">In seeming to augment it wastes it;</div></div></div>

<p>when Friar Laurence tells us that:—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied,</div>
<div class="i0">And vice sometime 's by action dignified;</div></div></div>

<p>and Portia that</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">There is no good without respect,</div></div></div>

<p>we have not only the keys to his ethics but
the texts for sermons which find living illustrations
in the fall of Angelo, of Coriolanus, of
Timon, and of many others of his protagonists.
Thus do his ethics temper and readjust for the
sphere of working life, those of the Divine
Enthusiast who legislated, in some respects, too
exclusively perhaps, for a kingdom which is
not of this world.</p>

<p>And so, his 'religion' being, to borrow an
expression of his own, "as broad and general
as the casing air," it has come to pass, that
Shakespeare has been claimed as an orthodox
Protestant by Knight, Bishop Wordsworth, and
Trench; as an orthodox Roman Catholic by
M. Rio, Mr. Simpson, and Father Bowden; and
as a simple agnostic by Gervinus, Kreysig, and
Professor Caird.</p>

<p>"He hath," says Sir Thomas Browne speaking
of himself, "one common and authentic philosophy
which he learnt in the schools, whereby he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369" href="#Page_369">[369]</a></span>
reasons and satisfies the reason of other men:
another more reserved and drawn from experience
whereby he satisfies his own." It may be,
it may quite well be, for he has left nothing to
justify conclusion to the contrary, that the
words of Shakespeare's Will—mere formula
though they be—are the expression of what he
"reserved" to satisfy himself, and that he
accepted the Christian Revelation. It may be,
that what we are <i>certainly</i> warranted in concluding
about him, represents all that can be
concluded, namely, that:—</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem">
<div class="i0">He at least believed in soul, was very sure of God.</div>
